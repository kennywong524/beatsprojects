RAZ6J396ABA0X,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound quality and portability,Kassandra,5,"The JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker is an absolute winner! This speaker delivers exceptional sound quality with deep bass and crystal-clear highs that make my music sound fantastic, whether I’m indoors or out. The 360-degree sound really fills the space and creates an immersive listening experience.One of the best features is its portability. The compact size makes it super easy to take anywhere, and it fits perfectly in my backpack or on a small shelf. Despite its small size, it packs a powerful punch and can get surprisingly loud without any distortion.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and has a good range, allowing me to play music from my phone without any interruptions. The battery life is impressive too, lasting for hours on a single charge, which is perfect for long outings or parties.Another big plus is its durability. The Flip 6 is waterproof and rugged, so I never worry about taking it to the beach or poolside. It’s built to withstand splashes and even the occasional drop.Overall, the JBL Flip 6 is a top-notch Bluetooth speaker that combines great sound, portability, and durability. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and high-quality speaker!","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AEFKX5OGOXDNDSPYOJOET63AUZPQ,True,9,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6
R260UY3O2FGTRG,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker,Kari Maddox,5,"These will always be my favorite speakers. This is the third I have bought of these. After years of one JB Flip, it finally gave out on me and I bought another. I have dropped one of these in a deep sink at work and after a couple days it was right back to playing as clear as before and was functioning just fine. This one was one I bought for my dad for Father’s Day. He loved the Camo color and of course when he tested it out it gave really strong and clear sound. The Bluetooth connected easily, and from my experience with these speakers, for me it was worth the money. I known it will last for years.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AFVQGGIXGMFQGPFQFNZOYMFWEKOA,True,1,Color: CamoStyle: Flip 6

I can say the sound is clean, crisp, and loud.The only CON is that it doesn't have much range so keep that in mind if you are purchasing. We paired it with his phone the first time and he was walking around during the party so the music kept cutting in and out.

RILMKXRAW75NM,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds excellent outdoors,Austin Yde,5,"This speaker has definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of audio quality. It does a have a few imperfections, but overall I think it deserves 5 stars. The mids and highs get drowned out a bit by the bass when indoors. However, I’ve found that when outside, the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on. It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy. Highly recommend for audiophiles looking for an outdoor speaker that you want to bring with you anywhere.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AF3PVTN5RKAL3R2VZTNN6W5N3BIQ,True,0,Color: GreyStyle: Flip 6
R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I’ve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I’ve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn’t believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I’ve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you’re entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you’re able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can’t help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you’ll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,7,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

I got it to upgrade from the 4 and I was surprised how much stronger the bass is on the 6. The sound it makes when it turns on and off is also a lot quieter as a bonus. There is one issue that I've had where the sound becomes distorted and crackly, but I found that having it connect to one Bluetooth device at a time fixes that.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AFKVBM7KXNQ3CSMNRUPM5A4VF4DA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6
