RCCKB7UX9YU1P,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit MaxSound,Kindle Customer,5,"The Tribit MaxSound Plus, 24 watt speaker is impressive. I picked this particular speaker because I was also getting the Tribit Bluetooth speaker recommended by Wirecutter and National Geographic and wanted to compare. I am keeping both. The Max Sound connects easily with my tablet and phone. It is rugged enough to haul around the house and outside. The bass boost is fantastic. I have tried it with an audiobook, as a noise machine (the truck going up a hill is impressive). This speaker is great to have around. It is not the gold star of speakers, but the Tribit MaxSound Plus is an excellent, affordable addition to anyone's house.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHSEQIPV3CXTQGVHLAGU4TETUEZA,True,1,Color: Blue
R1NRN0JL66TMT0,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars A Good Sounding, Inexpensive Bluetooth Speaker",John M. Sully,5,"I purchased this product to replace a Logitech X300 I gave to a friend who was facing several months w/o his stereo and only a phone. The Logitech sounded pretty good for my purposes, which is basically replacing hotel room radios. I needed to get a replacement as I will be travelling in a month or so and Amazon had this on a deal, so I snapped it up.I was favorably impressed with the build quality of the speaker when first unboxing it. It feels solid, with a nice grippy exterior, good heft, and rubber sealed aux and power ports. The speaker is quite handsome, too in its elegant oval form and basic black color scheme. It is a little bit wider than the Logitech, but not as high. The buttons on top of the unit are glossy black on flat black and are easy to see. The one drawback is the multifunction ""Play"" button whose function varies depending on how many times you press it. Press once and you pause, press twice to skip forward a track, press 3 times to skip back. And everything changes if a call is coming in. Oh well, I usually use the phone for these functions anyway. Pairing with my phone was cake, put the phone into pairing mode, press the Bluetooth button, select the speaker as the device on the phone, and accept the pairing request. Easy, peasy.But this is a speaker and no matter how nice it looks or how reasonable the UI, how does it sound? First remember that this is a fairly cheap Bluetooth speaker and it has its limitations. I didn't expect it to sound as good as my ZVOX Soundbase that I use as a Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom when I am not using it as a speaker for my TV. I also didn't expect it to sound as good as the HEOS 3 wireless speaker I use in my office. And I certainly didn't expect it to sound as good as my main 5.1 system in my living room. That being said, it did not disappoint. The sound was quite a bit more lively than the Logitech. Without the XBASS turned on the bass is solid and balanced with the midrange and treble. Overall, the sound is pretty good, much better than the Logitech. However, on dense mixes the sound can get a little muddy, I heard this on some afro-beat stuff I listened to with lots of horns. I wouldn't hold this against it too much, since these sorts of tracks are difficult for just about any reasonably price speaker of any size. Dense horn mixes are hard. With XBASS turned on the bass becomes artificially bloated and tends to muddy the sound. This might work for bass heavy music but did not work for my ears.Overall, the sound was quite good for this type of speaker, especially given its price and form factor. I gave it four stars for sound quality in the universe of small speakers I have had experience with. In it's class, it gets five stars. For my purposes, replacing a lousy hotel radio, it is superb.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020",AG23CZT7Z27IPZUEBQRGYX5NOAHA,True,7,Color: Black
R3JPI4WNEZC4A3,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I Never Know What to Expect........,Alphadog,5,"I never know what to expect when purchasing a sound device because I have hearing problems (highs are gone). I've learned to accept what I get most of the time. Before this purchase I was using a Philips 2 speaker bluetooth portable speaker which was giving me somewhat acceptable sound but lacking in definition. The reason for replacing it was because it was no longer reliable, having some power problems.I decided on the Tribit MaxSound Plus mainly because of the reviews. After all, I can't hear it through Amazon. I've had it now for just over 2 weeks and I'm loving it. I thought I would never use the Xbass but I actually leave it on all the time. It seems to give it the fullness it needs without overwhelming you with heavy bass. Super surprised and pleased!! The unit powers up and connects via bluetooth rather quickly. The bonus is that it actually does give you a 100 foot range (or more) on the bluetooth which was another surprise. This unit doesn't let things like walls or even buildings get in the way of reception. My Philips wasn't much distance at all and sometimes cut out if I just moved around. So, for the sound itself and the bluetooth range, I love it so far.But, there's always something I don't like so here it is........My Philips was about the same length but, it was thinner and lighter. I could slide it into my back pocket for example. No way in heck you can do that with the Tribit. It's HEAVY and kind of a round/triangle shape. No way to slide it into my pocket, any pocket (except a coat maybe). Also, the controls on top are almost invisible. The volume control on the Philips was easily turned up or down with a knob. The Tribit has a ""control panel"" on top that is like ""embossed"" so you can ""feel"" it I guess. You can hardly even see the controls because they are the same color as speaker enclosure. I'm turning it up and down frequently as well as pausing/changing songs and if I can't see what I want easily, it's no fun at all. I'm trying to learn the ""feel"" so I won't have a problem. BUT, if you want to turn it down quick, you're out of luck. Finding and pressing the + or - to increase or decrease the volume is not a good thing. Like my Philips, it too needs a knob of some kind. If nothing else, IT NEEDS A KNOB for volume only. The rest doesn't matter.I suppose the reason it's SO heavy is because of the great battery power. I have no idea how long it lasts (they claim it's 20 hours) but, I haven't run out of power yet between uses. One thing that doesn't matter to me so much but, it might bother others, is the fact that there is a LAG on the bluetooth like most products. Of course, you won't notice unless you are using it for videos.Also, I've had trouble skipping to the next song, or worse, the one after that. I end up changing it on my phone instead. I feel sure it's mostly me but still, not good.One last note.... A few times my song would speed up or something and sound weird but, not sure what that's all about. My phone or the Tribit??? Who knows. Maybe I can elaborate later.It's only been 2 wks so I'll update if the whole thing turns south but, for now, I believe it's a KEEPER mainly because it sounds so good to me!!!!!! Remember, I have hearing problems.Manufacturer.....Please put a volume knob on it and it will be almost perfect!!!!","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2019",AGNCDBEVENI6OYJHT3LFNZOAHHSA,True,5,Color: Black
R1VWFUTQFI7I4L,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for the price!,Ismael Negron,4,"I have to first admit that I am a fan of Tribit. I got my first bt speaker from them a few years ago (a StormBox Pro, the black in the picture) during a Black Friday sale, and like it so much that eventually I ended up owning three!Anyway, so my daughter lost one of the SBPro's at Coachella last year, and I've been thinking about replacing it. When I saw this Tribit Max Sound Plus model on sale my interest was picked. I liked the ""pill"" form factor, that it came in blue (my daughter's favorite color), and the price was right.I have using it for about a week now and it pretty much parallels the pro's and con's of my other Tribit device. The sound quality is excellent for a device of this size. The bass is weak unless you turn on the X-Bass mode, and then it is good. Not as ""bumpy"" as the Bose SoundLink Mini, but at about a 7th of the price, it is great. The BT is strong and reliable (never had any issues), it keep playing in my basement office even when I went upstairs to my room. What I really like about Tribit is their ""Party Mode"", which allows multiple devices to be linked to play the same content, so you can place a bunch of them around an area and still cover it with soft music. I have enjoyed ""Party Mode"" with the SBPro's, but not the MaxSound Plus, since I currently own just one. However, my wife want to get one for her sister, so I will get a second one soon.The fact that it is IPX7 rated makes it perfect for use where it might get wet, or even submerged (up to 3 feet)...it does not flote, so... be careful.The battery does seem to take a while to fully charge, but last the whole fricking day (over 15 hours).Bottom line:Great sound with good bass (with XBass activated), strong BT connection, has a microphone for calls, waterproof but does not float.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AED4VFHZR77VDBOMHOSZET4ITYFA,True,2,Color: Blue
R1E7BM5FBFYZI6,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars No regrets with this speaker. Excellent for its price.,Kelly,5,"I bought the Tribit MaxSound Plus for $60 at the time, and my expectations were as such, but I was more than impressed. Out of the box, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it felt. It's got the well-built mass one can appreciate by just holding it. It lends to a respectable amount of grip because of the rubberized matte finish over the whole thing. Its got a minimalistic black metal grill that sits flush with its contours and a cord lanyard for easy lugging around.The battery lasts quite a long time. I've used it over a month, 2-4 hours a day at a medium to loud volume level, and I've only had to charge it maybe two or three times. It charges via a USB-C port in the back, with the aux input right next it.The sound quality is very good. This is a $60 (at the time of writing) speaker we're talking about. And it's really, very good. There are 3 EQ modes: clean, XBass, and audiobook mode, which are indicated by LED. Music and audio playback is appreciably crisp, and is not distorted even at higher volume levels. While I will not praise (nor am I credible to say so at any rate) the speaker's range of frequency (especially how I wish there was just a teensy bit more treble dynamic range), it does a spectacular job of bringing balance, clarity, and tone, all where they need to be. And the oomph. Oh, the oomph. The lows are satisfyingly heavy for a small-form speaker and punchy enough without taking away from the overall balance.The Bluetooth is Bluetooth - I won't get into depth about it because Bluetooth tends to be atleast similar versions across platforms. But it's good. Only thing I'd gripe about is the speaker's relatively short timer turning off during inactivity, which can be annoying, because you would have to physically get up and press the speaker on again.Although I wouldn't bring this speaker for heavy-duty or ""rugged"" activities like camping or going to the beach, this speaker is perfect for casual listening and home or office/work use. It's powerful without being overwhelming, and it delivers. I'm very happy with my purchase. The Tribit MaxSound Plus is absolutely the bangin' for its buck.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2022",AENIUCNBAXSGADOA7G4AWSYVA5HA,True,14,Color: Black

R3FUSDIONHGXG6,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Overall the best out of the 3 Tribit speakers I tested,RJM,5,"The media could not be loaded. I purchased all 3 Tribit products, StormBox Micro, Stormbox and Maxsound Plus for my own personal self-testing. I wanted to see if all the good review were true.In comparison to the other two lower models, this speaker has a good overall sound. From the Bass to Mids it sounds great and loud. Like the other models the sound comes off very clean, no static sound what so over or extra noise coming off the speaker grill. I played all different types of music racing from classical, instrumental, pop, hip-hop, rap, bass and rock.Songs played:* Dinah Jane - Bottled Up• Ed Sheeran (Camila Cabello & Cardi B) - South of the Border• Maroon 5 - Memories• Conkarah - Banana* George Winston - Variations on the Canon• Hilary Stagg - Easy Days• Guns n ' Roses - Sweet child of mine• Yiruma - River flows in you• Post Malone - Wow• Beyonce - Love on top• Cardi B - Bodak Yellow• Matisyahu - One Day• Lil Wayne - How to love• Notorious BIG - Hypnotize• Lil Waye - A Milli• Brennan Savage - To the MoonI didn't play it at 100% but at 75% it still sound clean and the speakers didn't sound like it was gonna pop. It plays the classical/instrumental songs as if it were a Bose speaker. This is not a surround sound movie theater speaker, but it does give off more of the sound than other models. I'm pretty sure if you get two MaxSound plus speakers it would sound like you had surround sound. I'd love to test two of these paired up.I thought I could pair up any other Tribit bluetooth speaker, but that didn't work. After several attempts It didn't pair up to the StormBox or Stormbox Micros. Another thing about the bluetooth is that I was able to control the song being played on the MaxSound Plus through the StormBox Speaker and the StormBox Micro. When I pressed the circle on the Stormbox or the square on the Stormbox Micro twice, whatever song is up next in the que started playing. When I press those buttons once the current song would be played on the speaker which I just pressed the button on. That feature I thought was neat. Sometimes also, when I play songs on the MaxSound Plus it would automatically switch other to the Micro on its own. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of 5. One thing that I did find kind of annoying while testing the speakers is that I would sometimes start the songs on the MaxSound Plus and seconds later the music would jump on its own to the micro. This happened more than twice. I know that the unit you play your Tribit speakers on remembers the last connections. But I tried having the Stormbox as the last speaker being played as well and it also randomly happened to play from the MaxSound plus to the Stormbox Micro. Please fix this issue.This product has some weight to it and is not light at all so I'd hate to drop it. When held in your hand the material is not slippery and you feel like you have a grip. Some speakers and headphones out there have this same mat finish and after a few year or when you don't use it it gets all sticky and starts to fall apart. I hope that this does not happen to the Tribit speakers. It has a lanyard that you can hold on to or latch it on to something like a back back. I'd probably take an S-Caribner with a bungee and put that in place of what is being used now if I were to hang it on to something like a backpack or bag.Battery seems to be good on the MaxSound Plus. It has an auto shut off feature if it hasn't been playing any sounds. This is also for the case for the Stormbox and Stormbox Micro. The Stormbox frequently turns itself off and I have to keep pairing it with the iPad or iPhone which is annoying. After about 20 minutes of not playing anything the MaxSound Plus is still synced while this StormBox Micro is still playing songs. The MaxSound Plus shuts off around 30 minutes of not being used.For the price this is a great speaker. I will have to update my review, if I get a second pair and try to pair the two same speakers. The Stormbox and Stormbox mini says you can pair two of the same speakers “Party Mode”, but I didn’t see that int he manual. Also this came with an audio cable for those that do not have bluetooth capability.I would most likely keep this, the MaxSound Plus or the StormBox Micro since I experienced bluetooth and power issues with the StormBox. The MaxSound is good for an all day outing even overnight trip. 20 hours of play is awesome!","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2020",AEZPYGQIA7VIEBXX4Z4WGKP7LBMQ,True,68,Color: Black
R1ZICJVEVL4I8Z,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Portable Performer,BDM,5,"You'll notice the heft of this unit right away when taking it out of its packaging. It is surprisingly heavy for its size - much heavier than older bluetooth speakers I have of similar size.The sound quality is very good for what it is. The extra bass mode has its own button, and for my tastes, I've toggled back and forth but prefer to leave it on. Like most speakers, if you can put this near a wall, a back splash on your kitchen counter or bathroom sink, etc., you'll get more sound radiating towards you and the sound will seem to have more depth.Like another reviewer, I bought this case for the MaxSound Plus, and it is a very nice and fairly snug fit, alghough there is still some room above/below the speaker in the mesh, velcro sealed compartment for a few cords and other small items: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F4J8Q1/I don't have this speaker's little brother to compare it to, but I'll be honest and say that I expected just a little bit more based on the reviews I read... a little more bass, a little more volume - that is, until I did an A/B comparison with some of my older bluetooth speakers. That's when I realized that my expectations were too high, and this speaker is exponentially better in every way than what I had been using.Here are three of the ways I've used this and how it performed:First, I took my sons and their friend to a local field and we practiced shooting soccer balls on a very windy day. I put the speaker on a camp chair about 15-20 yards from where we were playing, and I maxed it out (phone and speaker volumes). It sounded very loud close to the chair, but where we were, it was just a nice background sound. If you're trying to rock a noisy party, then expect to just have some nice sound to hear in the background. If it will be fairly peaceful and you'll be close by, then you can expect to have good volume with a fairly full sound. This speaker has a flat curve to, I believe, around 50Hz. The bass is surprising, but don't expect the feel of a subwoofer - something that can physically move a lot of air and create a lot of sound pressure - especially outdoors.The second is very similar to the first. We used it in the back of my Yukon with the tailgate up on an even windier day (like too windy to talk on the phone windy), and the sound was great as long as we were within 10 feet of the truck or so.The third is what has me most excited. My wife was cleaning the house, and my boys and I wanted to watch a movie. We layed 3 wide on my oldest's bed and streamed Netflix to a 10"" tablet. We used this MaxSound Plus for the sound, wtih the extra bass feature on, and just had the speaker behind the tablet on my lap. The sound quality was full and simply excellent for this purpose, and we never went above half volume on the tablet.If the speaker is connected to a source, you can't take it away, but the MaxSound Plus does have a separate bluetooth button. Just hit it and connect with a different device if you wish.All in all, I'm very pleased wtih my purchase, as this is a nice portable unit that fits most if not all of my needs. Really, the only other speaker I'm considering purchasing to round out my needs is this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WF78GS4/. For the rest, this one has it covered.Let me know if you have any questions. I've built many of my own bookshelf speakers and subwoofers, as well as my own portable bluetooth speaker. I've probably spent between $30k-$40k over the years on audio equipment alone. I know enough to at least try to help out.

RO1DBHSPL36M4,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Blown away by this speaker, but BT buzz/hiss caused me to rate it lower than I wanted to",Xmetal,4,"Update: The problem is still there and so annoying (BECAUSE this would be and ... to be fair still is, along with this speaker's ""little brother"" the XSound Go .... my favorite or at least tied for being my favorite) .. The sound issue still happens but its mainly an issue at lower (like the LOWEST volumes) ... the ""buzzing/bt"" sound is always in the background BUT if you turn the volume up, you will probably not even notice an issue (and the sound of the audio, no matter the EQ setting IS that good) ... I dont want to get nutty with fractions/decimals but i bumped the 3 out of 5 to a 4 out of 5 ... 3 seemed low even with this problem ... i'd say .... a 3 3/4 or 3.75 would be my score ... maybe a 4.5 out of 5 would have been my score (even with lower battery life than the Xsound Go) if it just didn't have that ""buzzing"" or ""hum"" sound. If it were my perfect speaker (the battery life of the XSound Go, but the EQ settings this speaker does have now... i'd give it a 5 out of 5 and i never give that rating out figuring ""something can always be better""---------------------------------I am redoing part of what I had pre-written in a review to post after dealing with Tribit/Tribit’s parent company (they are a blast to deal with) and received a second unit that I just tested with two devices and it not only has the same issue .. it may be worse (louder) … I love Tribit speakers and the same devices with a two Xsound Surfs and two different Xsound Gos (lower on the product line) DO NOT have this issue. The TL:DR of it is a static/buzz/interference issue I keep hearing … the low end LFS speaker I got for $15 years ago is the only one with this same type of buzzing/humm…. OTHER THAN this very annoying issue .. and maybe wishing the battery life was better (The cheaper Xsound Go should not have BETTER battery life in my view) … well other than that .. this speaker blows me away and SOMEHOW is still one of my favorites but due to both having an annoying static/buzz .. my Tribit Xsound GO may still be my favorite model speaker.Pros:- the Sound … OH BOY THE SOUND. They keep taking the lower models (Xsound Surf ~~> XSound Go ~> MaxSound Plus) and making it better. HOW? … I feel the only issue with the Surf or the GO, is that sometimes in some lower volumes, and some genres, it sounds GREAT .. but a little too “boomy” …like a good Subwoofer on a track that doesn’t need a Subwoofer “thump” to the sound. The sound is TOTALLY a “clean” thump/bass but not always needed and to be honest… I have no issue with that really … the sound of the Surf and the Go is so good, I am “yeah I can live with that”.That is where the EQ built into the MaxSound Plus comes in. I have some other speakers or earbuds where there are built in Eqs but they almost seem gimmicky at times. Like maybe one is the best but the others are not that good. This is NOT the case with the MaxSound Plus.Music Mode is the sort of default mode (it DOES remember the last mode it was on, by the way) that sounds good but while I here a good thump in the bass, its not overdone on the tracks I have listened to so far. Bass Mode (whatever they call it) is a better sound than the Surf and the Go, but I’d say the same profile with boosted bass … STILL not overdone where it muddies things up …I have not listening to rap yet on this speaker but I think genres like that may benefit from the extra bass. It’s NOT an extra bass that distorts everything, I’d say .. though I admit I don’t turn these speakers up full volume as that would just be too loud for me anyway.THE MODE THAT SHOCKED ME not because it sounds the best, but because of what I have heard from others who LOVE the MaxSound Plus, but say “yeah … ‘audio book mode’ is useless and you will never use it”… I figured I’d have the same view but I was WRONG. On some jazz/instrumental tracks it sounds great in all three modes and “audio book mode” I think they are calling it is … more of a “flatter” or more balanced EQ where the low and high ends are not overstated.Honestly I have an Ortizan X10 that while I don’t dislike … sounds of even on it’s best EQ setting. honestly … The Maxsound Plus’s audio-book mode sounds better than the “Dynamic” (I forgot if they have a name for it) Ortizan X10 Dynamic EQ mode. Things like in the other two Tribit models I have .. just sound Dynamic BUT balanced and crisp/clear.I know everyone has different experiences (look at the buzz/static issue I mentioned) … but I don’t hear the “sounds like a tin can” or “this sounds terrible .. there is no bass in any EQ mode” sound of the other negative reviews say. It’s that buzz/hum on my units that drive me nuts … everything else sounds GREAT.I did buy mine at a discount and … while I love all of this … I have seen the MaxSound Plus at double the price of Tribit’s XSound GO… “is it worth it?” … eh .. I cant say “no” but also considering that much of a price difference (again that is not what I paid for mine) … the GO is REALLY good too.This may sound odd (esp since I don’t turn up the volume all the way) but … there seems to be a “power” to the MaxSound Plus (the XSound Go is not far off) where it SEEMS like if you want to turn it up and have the same good audio the speaker wouldn’t have an issue with it, .. unlike some speakers you may here where past say 60 or 70% volume things get distorted. Again I have NOT tested this.- Build Quality – this is typical for Tribit speakers and that just means a great build quality- Connection – this connects pretty fast and I have had ZERO hiccups in the sound cutting out or disconnecting … though the battery life not being as long as I’d hope may have caused it to shut off once and the life was showing 50% left when I reconnected.. .not sure what happened thereUnsure thoughts:- Eh I cant say this how low battery life and even if it did, I’d be ok with it up to a point. I know its not what is advertised and my Xsound GO’s seem to last longer..Comments:- this speaker is bigger than the Xsound Go by a little bit and I wasn’t expecting that much of a difference … not a pro .. not a con (unless you really want a small speaker) .. I can live with this.------------------------------------------------------------I am so disappointed in this speaker.. mainly due to the buzz/static sound. I can even live with the battery life thing … the REASON I am so disappointed is that if it did not have that static/buzz (again two different units) .. this speaker MAY get a 5 out of 5 from me .. maybe 4.5 out of 5 due to the battery life being lower then Tribit’s XSound Go. I have to go on my experience with the speaker and give it a lower grade than I want … again if it wasn’t for that buzz (and if I find a way around that with the devices I want to use it with I will post an update, increasing the rating) … this may be a 4.5 out of 5 and one of my favorite speakers I own .. with that issue it … IRONICALLY is still up there. The issue I have had (not in the Xsound GO with the same devices) .. may keep the Xsound GO as my #1 favorite though.I know some who have no issue with static or buzzing (my way of describing it) .. maybe it’s my devices. I WILL NOT say avoid this, but I just note my issue. (really a single issue) … I have to give Tribit/Thousandshores a 5+ out of 5 for support. I … I don’t see myself contacting them about the replacement. I got the first at as discount and the second speaker for free, and .. I think I can live with the issues.Overall the Tribit Xsound Go maybe a better (esp with battery life and cheaper price) bang for your buck, purchase.In case it’s not apparent .. I am more DISAPPOINTED as this is not usually a problem I have with Tribit products and as I said .. without the issue with the buzz, it WOULD BE a co favorite with my Tribit XSound Go's .. mainly because the Go's have a better battery … I DON'T hate the MSP .. I hate the issue I have had with such a GREAT speaker.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,True,0,Color: Black

REN0G6R1Z3D6W,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars Best speaker ever for audiobooks except for one awful design decision,R. C. Jackson,3,"The good: I listen to audiobooks constantly, and the audiobook equalizer setting on this speaker is unparalleled. Most Bluetooth speakers are built for music and are all about maximizing bass, so they are pretty bad at emphasizing the frequencies of an audiobook narrator's voice. I can't say enough about how clear audiobook narration is with this speaker.The questionable: It's early days yet, but it seems that even when listening at moderate volume and with my phone right next to the speaker (so it doesn't have to strain to maintain the Bluetooth connection), the battery life is about 10 hours or so. That's half of the ""up to 20 hours"" advertised. I need more experience with the speaker to verify this, though, so I might be wrong. My old speaker, an Anker, was much smaller and lighter but delivered a solid 18-20 hours of listening on a charge. I thought the Tribit, being much weightier, would have a larger battery than the Anker. I wanted to remove a star for this, but until I've used it more I think that's unfair.The bad: One of the design goals of this speaker seems to have been ""make it as easy as possible to press the Bluetooth pairing button by mistake."" What happens when you accidentally press the Bluetooth pairing button? The speaker enters Bluetooth pairing mode, and the only way to get it out of pairing mode is to power cycle the speaker. They could've designed it so it was a toggle: one press enters Bluetooth pairing mode, a second press exits Bluetooth pairing mode. But they didn't. So if you accidentally press the button, you have to turn the speaker off and then back on and wait for it to connect. Now let's see how they made it super easy to accidentally press the button.First off, the row of buttons is black on black. No contrast whatsoever. In an even a moderately low light situation you'd better know exactly where the button you want to press is located, or be very good at reading the button icons with your finger like Braille.Then there's the placement. The Bluetooth pairing button is immediately next to the most often used button on the speaker: the Play/Pause button. They put a button you'll use at most once a year right next to a button you'll use 30 times a day. Why didn't they put the Bluetooth pairing button off to the side, or any place except right in the middle of the other buttons?Another thing they could've done is require a long press to enter Bluetooth pairing mode. That way if you accidentally pressed it it wouldn't do anything. But, no, an accidental short press is all it takes to send you on a trip down restart lane.I wanted to remove 2 stars for this, but I know that bad UX design bothers me more than most people, so I settled for only removing 1 star. If I could award half stars I would've given this speaker 3.5.Update:1) I have confirmed that the battery life is substandard compared to previous Bluetooth speakers I have owned.2) The battery problem is magnified by the fact that it will not charge while you are using it.3) I've also found a related bug: I have the speaker plugged into power and I'm using it. But because it doesn't charge while you're using it, eventually it warns me that battery power is low. So I turn it off to let it charge. But it doesn't charge. It won't start charging until I unplug it from power, then plug it back in again.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AEQN4UKCDVEDJURABTNPY3EGNEIQ,True,2,Color: Black
RISXQT2QLB8JZ,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Upgraded Tribit MaxSound Plus, Two are Much Better Than One!!!!",newelw,5,"I am a BIG fan of Tribit Bluetooth speakers! I currently own a XSound Go, three Stormboxes, two Stormbox Pros, two Stormbox Micro 2s, two Homes, two Stormbox Blasts, and now I also own three MaxSound Pluses (one original and two upgraded). The ones I am least impressed with are the Stormbox Pros (does not reproduce bass as I expected) and other than the Blast (which is truly amazing), I am most impressed with the MaxSound Plus.I had always wished that you could pair two MaxSound Plus speakers for true stereo, but that was not possible with the earlier versions. Once I saw there was an upgraded version, I watched some videos by Alan Ross Reviews on YouTube and sure enough, you can now pair the upgraded version with the earlier version for true stereo. I received my upgraded version yesterday and the pairing went very well and the sound of both speakers together is wonderful!! If you close your eyes in the sound field, you would never think that all that sound comes from two small speakers.The tests Alan Ross did shows that the performance of the newly upgraded MaxSound Plus is almost identical to the earlier version. The new Plus does have a Music Mode and an Audio Book mode to compliment the XBass mode. Since the speaker is small, I always operate them using the XBass mode to get as much bass as possible, which is surprising for this small speaker. There is also a USB C charging connector on the new version (comes with USB C cable and 3.5 audio cable).Below is the procedure that I used to do a stereo pairing, using one upgraded version and one original version. The instructions in the manual for the upgraded version for doing a stereo pairing does not work with my original version and must be instructions for pairing two upgraded versions:1. Turn on both speakers and assign the upgraded version as your left master/primary speaker.2. Disconnect any bluetooth-paired device from the speakers.3. Press the Bluetooth button on the left master/primary speaker and hold it down until you hear a tone and the phrases ""Stereo Mode"" and ""Left Channel"".4. Connect your bluetooth device to the left master/primary speaker.Note: The instructions in the little manual for the upgraded version says to press the bluetooth button on the right secondary speaker, but every time I did that, it was disconnecting the speakers from stereo mode, so that must be instructions for two upgraded Pluses (can not verify since I do not own two myself).Note: I ended up getting another upgraded MaxSound Plus and can confirm that they do pair very nicely following the normal instructions and once paired, they will auto-pair when both speakers are turned on. I ended up having a bit of an issue in that Tribit shipped me a ThunderBox Plus instead and that appears to be the replacement to the upgraded MaxSound Plus speakers. I did get to confirm that the ThunderBox Plus WILL NOT pair with either the original MaxSound Plus nor the Upgraded MaxSound Plus, even though that new speaker still shows MaxSound Plus on the right rear of the speaker (must be a firmware change). You can tell the ThunderBox Plus by a small recess in the front metal speaker grill.Again, I am a fan of most of the Tribit Bluetooth speakers and bang for buck, they are a great deal.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2022",AGGSMYZJWAVPWGJ3BNWB4CZX2CBQ,True,33,Color: Black

R2WGACHTHXIVJJ,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Speakers bluetooth works,Robin P.,5,"I had a problem, I purchased a nice bluetooth player but if I used it to connect to my cars bluetooth, I couldn't connect my phone. I am someone who enjoys very nice sound for my music and only use HiDef players and FLAC formats for my music. I had been using my USB connector but that only accepted mp3 which compared to FLAC and a nice HiDef player sounds a bit flat. These speakers fit the bill quite well. I added velcro to the bottom and attach them to my dash. I also made a mylar shade to keep the sun from overheating them. I purchased two which gave me stereo sound and 24+24 = 48 Watts of sound. No complaints. These sound almost as good as my internal speakers. Actually, they sound just as good.I have found once you connected them to the player, the bluetooth works flawlessly to connect to the speakers. A few times I have had to turn one off and turn it back on for them to pair together to provide stereo sound. Normally, they work flawlessly. I turn them on before and get it set-up prior to driving down the road. The battery life is claimed to be 20 hours. I have had these on short 30 minute drives to work since I got them and I have yet to have to recharge the speakers. It's been 11 days since I set these up which includes 7 work days. Still no need to recharge them. I also use them whenever I drive to the store or to visit a friend. They work well and are one of the few bluetooth speakers I have found that pair with another to provide stereo sound. They do this almost flawlessly automatically once set-up.I have an HiFi Player that lasts 20 hours on a battery and these lasted longer. Of course I also used the player independently a little. So I am guessing it works as advertised for 20 hours give or take a little bit. I compare the sound from my HiFi Player against other sources and so that is how I judge the sound. I am aware that you can get even better sound from well designed speakers and have very nice speakers for use at home. However, I don't know of too many bluetooth speakers that can pair with others to reproduce stereo sound and sound as good as these. I am not one who goes for excessive bass.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2023",AE5RMQU7IFMMLWUUSSBFP7UGLAMQ,True,5,Color: Black

R2TMWDM387AFJ5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid speaker - updated review,D. Ellis,5,"Original review: Just received this after seeing good reviews. Sound is okay. My 8 year old Anker was better but unfortunately the battery reached the end of its life. Beside the bass being weaker compared to my older and less expensive speaker, my main complaint is that it repeatedly drops connection as soon as whatever you're listening to ends. It does not drop while actively in use, so that's good, but won't stay connected once the music ends. I'm not talking about a 15 minute time out, I'm talking like 15 seconds. Disconnect, reconnect, disconnect, reconnect, repeat until you start music again. It's so annoying. I tried doing the factory reset and that helped for a little bit and it started up again. I'm sitting like 4ft away from my speaker, so it's not a phone to speaker distance thing. Never have had this issue with any of my other Bluetooth devices. Maybe I got a bad one, but probably going to return. Not happy with this especially since it's not super cheap.UPDATE:Changed review from 2 stars to 5 stars. I returned my original speaker, but Tribit customer service reached out to me and offered to replace my purchase free of charge and shipped a replacement directly to me. I have been running the speaker both active and idle for an hour or so now and I have not had any connection drops. I also think that this speaker sounds better than the first one I got. After returning my original speaker, I went with another familiar brand (newer version of what I used to have), and it is smaller and definitely sounds worse than this Tribit. All together I'm glad I gave this one another try. I think I will relinquish my other speaker to being the spare, and this will be my main one. Thanks for the customer service, I didn't expect it!","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AET5AUS5KKNSJTNS5LZOSL2OXVYA,True,2,Color: Black
R3LS36HGF624XS,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Does the job, mostly",Stan A,4,"My primary need for a speaker is to be used outdoors while working in the backyard. I like to be able to move around my 1/4 acre-ish backyard and still be able to hear music clearly. Well, that's a tall task for a small speaker. Obviously a larger speaker is better, but not nearly as portable as this. I've tried A LOT of speakers and had pretty much given up on finding the right one. Well, this one is about as close as any that I've bought (and returned). I believe I'll be keeping this one, unless the performance fades in the comings weeks/months.Pros:- This has a good amount of pleasing bass when nearby. It's not thundering or booming - I mean, it's a small speaker! But there is a nice deep hum that resonates well when you are near it. This would be good for a small, chill gathering on your patio.- The build seems sturdy. Good heft without being heavy, if that makes sense.- Overall good sound profile. Does not distort even at max volume.- The blue color is actually pretty sharp. I prefer black, but this stands out nicely without being annoying to the eye.- This speaker is acceptable for my outdoor needs, but I believe it would be excellent indoors in a small to medium sized room.- I like having a lanyard. Keeps the speaker clean from my dirty landscaping hands.- Battery life seems good. I tend to play it at full volume, and have gotten 10-12 hours out of it.- Good value speaker in performance vs cost.Cons:- It does not project as loudly as I'd like, but it's still audible from across the yard. I wish it had another 10 watts of power, and it would be perfect for my needs.- The lanyard is basically a low quality shoestring. Other speakers have something more rugged like paracord.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023",AFHFRRJMWINIOJN3JQRIUBMJBPVQ,True,13,Color: Blue

R3TVDEODMDXDE6,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker but frustrating low volume issues (partly an Android problem),Noneya Bizness,4,"I've had my speaker for a few years now and still like it a lot. Sound quality is great, good midtones and bass for a small package and not ""tinny"" sounding at all. I've used it in the shower many times and have never had any issues with water. It's been dropped a number of times and never had any issues.I'm writing this review primarily to point out one flaw, and that is the low volume listening. In general, if you want to have fine control over volume, opt for a speaker that uses a knob instead of buttons. By their very nature, buttons can only increase volume at pre-defined intervals (steps) and there's no fine-tuning possible. If 0% is muted and 100% is maximum, stepping up the volume one time would move it, say, from 0% to 10% or 10% to 20%, etc. That would be a 10% step.When connected over Bluetooth (particularly to an Android device .. I can't comment on iOS but I assume it is the same way), the mobile device volume is synced to the speaker's volume intervals. So even if your phone normally (without the speaker connected) allows you to adjust volume in fine increments (like 1%, 2% 3% ... etc), once the speaker is connected, your phone volume is locked to the speaker intervals (10%, 20%, 30% ... etc).If you want to listen to your speaker at quiet volumes, you may find that you're stuck choosing between 20% (too quiet) and 30% (too loud) and it is impossible to find a comfortable listening volume. I like to keep my volume low at night as to not disturb others. On the Tribit, I can't set it loud enough that I can hear it, but quiet enough that it isn't disturbing late at night.If this is an issue for you, your mobile device may have a workaround. On Android, you can enable Developer Mode (search online to find out how) and then search for a setting called ""Disable Absolute Volume"" and turn that on. That should give you fine-grained control and not force sync the device volume with the Tribit speaker volume.That will only work IF you use your mobile device to change the volume. It won't fix the poor volume stepping if you use the speaker's physical volume buttons. That is a flaw of the speaker itself.More volume steps (like 5% increments instead of 10%, for example) would have been an improvement for this product.If you don't care about low volume listening then this review isn't for you, and the speaker is absolutely worth a purchase :)","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2022",AHCPX5Y4FNNMLXH6GA4KWCHCCMXA,True,19,Color: Black
ROFLZDIFNIUJS,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Competitive, but not the miracle speaker others seem to think it is.",A Guy,4,"This thing is right about what it needs to be. For the price, it's solidly average. What I find lacking is the treble. Everything else is good (but not outstanding).So no, I do not agree with the numerous reviews claiming this is the best speaker for the money. It's definitely competitive, but it's not notably better than similar speakers. That said, I wouldn't talk someone out of buying it for any reason. It's a good option.As of my writing of this review, this speaker is not compatible with Tribit's app, so no EQ adjustments. Wording in the app seems to imply that this functionality MAY be implemented for this (and other) speakers in the future, but I wouldn't count on it. It's a shame, because an in-built EQ could conceivably bring it to a point where I'm actually very pleased with the speaker. But as is, it's just okay.I've had a ton of bluetooth speakers. It's an unexpected hobby of mine. One thing I'd advise someone to keep in mind is that a lot of these speakers have tons of reviews overhyping their performance. None of these are miracle speakers. They can be great, but don't expect any of them to blow you away.Also, you pay extra for Bose, JBL, B&O etc., but even though these more affordable brands can impress, they never quite reach the level of those more expensive speakers. I'd say the best of these more affordable options get to about 80% of the best of the big-name brands (of course, not all models are created equal). If you were to ask me what the sweet-spot for portable bluetooth speaker was, I'd point you to the Bose Soundlink Flex. Bose really knocked it out of the park with that one especially. Don't bother spending any more than that for a portable bluetooth speaker (if you're looking for a behemoth that's technically portable but inconvenient to lug around, the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom is my current favorite, though I'd love to try the cult-classic Aiwa Exos-9 someday).","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2023",AHJTPV4IWJ5JDQX7L2FGES5VQ7UA,True,9,Color: Black

All 3 had a deal, both Tribits had a coupon and the M6 was on a lightning deal.MaxSound Plus is far superior to the XSound Go, now the MaxSound Plus is almost twice the price. But it feels only slightly heavier than the Go, and only slightly larger. If you need the speaker to be smaller I'd recommend looking into the very small options out there. The bass boost and audiobook options on the MaxSound Plus make the sound quality shine compared to the XSound Go.Eduplink M6 is a 360° speaker so comparing to Tribits Stormbox ($100+) would be better but the M6 is priced around XSound Go. The sound isn't as clear as the Tribit MaxSound Plus. The bass also doesn't compare to MaxSound Plus which has bass boost capabilities. The M6 is far lighter than either of the Tribit speakers by far. It feels half the weight of the MaxSound. But it is slightly bigger than the MaxSound.-XSound Go is the smallest of these 3 speakers.-MaxSound Plus is the loudest-MaxSound Plus has the most clarity-M6 will float-M6 is 360° so it sounds the same on every side-M6 has RGB lighting effects ""party lights""-M6 arrived with a cosmetic defect-All 3 have a cover for the charge port, USB-C-Tribit cover is easier to open, better design-All 3 have auxiliary port-All 3 say 20+ hours of battery life. It took me 3 days to drain the MaxSound Plus.I'm leaning towards keeping the Eduplink M6 because I need a beach speaker. The XSound Go doesn't stand a chance in this race. The real comparison is between M6 and MaxSound Plus.Both are plenty loud enough, MaxSound Plus has better clarity and much better bass. The M6 feels half the weight, the woven material on the M6 and silicone ends make me think it will do better keeping the sand out. The front of the MaxSound Plus has holes and if the speaker is knocked in the sand I fear it may get sand on the drivers. The M6 was almost half the price. The M6 feels like you could throw it and withstand damage better, pure speculation.If this speaker was lighter it would be my new beach speaker. I am keeping the M6 as I already have to carry a beach tent, towels, sand castle toys, & a toddler. The weight played the deciding factor for me.","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2022",AF6C2GUI6UUB3VMX4U2XYAXSS3NQ,True,3,Color: Black
R21TTA05LJ4D70,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Pure quality sound,Htet,5,"I have fallen in love with Tribit since their Tribit Xfree Tune headphone which amazed me with how a budget bluetooth headphone can perform. Then, I have bought quietplus 72, xsound go and stormbox micro, each of which showed very good offerings.I was impressed with stormbox micro, in particular, by its size-defying bass and when I planned to buy a little bigger speaker, maxsound plus was the first one I thought. I did a lot of research before buying it since there are a lot of new speakers out there, earfun uboom l, soundcore boost and newer motion 300 for eg.I've seen some reviews said that the maxsound plus is a neutral sounding speaker and the bass is not that impressive, etc. I am not an audiophile and I guess I'd prefer a fun, energetic sound than neutral sound signature. Yet, I still gave it a shot and it really impressed me. It produces a good balanced sound yet with enough thump which was lacking in smaller xsound go. While the micro has superb bass amidst it's size, maxsound plus outshines it in clarity and sound stage which I really expected.It's been out there for a while and it won't excite you with fancy design and features like newer competitors. Yet it does a great job regards to sound which still holds its reputation even in comparison with newer speakers unless bass is the only thing you're looking for in a speaker or you are comparing it with larger and heavier speakers like jbl charge 5 or motion 600.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023",AFOM3YLFJEJMWEDDCVKWZJBW4YKQ,True,0,Color: Black
R2PFM87FN7CVU5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Speaker for Price,Stygimoloch,5,"I purchased this to replace an older speaker I bought about a decade ago (not same company or anything). After searching and some light research I figured I'd give this company's Maxsound Plus a try.First impressions were packaging. The box it comes in is quite nice and it is packaged in the box very well and professional looking. Easy, simple Bluetooth connecting.I did some sound checks with different genres and was quite impressed with the quality coming out. One of the best things I noticed is how clear audio is and it scales fantastic with volume with no distortions. With and without the extra bass feature.Audio usually always sounds better with the extra bass feature on, giving a much better range of the audio of what you are playing. As others have said, depending on your environment, is how well you can really get out of the extra feature.Depending on what I played, sometimes something might be too bass-y and I found it better with it off, which is very simple by just hitting the button on top. Easy on and off. I also have used this for listening to podcasts and radio programs and found it's better with the bass off as it gives better vocal clarity. Mind that the speaker does do a good job without bass feature on, you still get a nice spectrum of the notes.After some testing with full charges, I was able to get about 8-9 hrs of use with bass feature on, and about 16-18 hours with bass off. That was with constant use with it on, at what I guess would be about 30%-50% volume. With intermittent use, with bass on and off randomly to suit my tastes, the speaker can go quite a long time before needing a charge. It probably does hit close to 20 hours with intermittent use.Last few notes; I never had a problem with going out of range and probably never hit close to its stated range. I have gotten the speaker wet, not soaked, and it holds up very well with no changes in audio and no hiccups.This speaker does a great job of directing sound, so if you need or want a speaker that you can put in a corner of a room, or want to have a specific spot in an area to 'throw' the music only in one area, this is great for that. If you want to put this in the middle of a room on say a table and want the whole room with sound, the other Tribit speaker is probably best for you.Pros-Great clear sound-No distortions through volume changes and can get quite loud-Extra bass feature is nice and does add a nice punch to your music, but isn't required to hear great sound.-Great range from audio source for the size-Great waterproofing-Nice compact design you can carry easily-Throws the audio in one direction very wellCons-Battery life can be quite well, but may not be the length you are looking for between charges.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020",AGT6BIEDHUUERLVMTG7S4NQABJCQ,True,9,Color: Black
R1EOQCVBTLRPPW,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I think best in its class,ErieEddie,5,"So far so good. First off my speaker is the anti-lemon. I’m not experiencing any of the issues mentioned in the negative reviews. Seems Tribit, like many others and perhaps most manufacturers have quality control issues especially since the pandemic began. So if you indeed received a problematic speaker perhaps a Tribit will work with you to make things right. I hear they have excellent customer service. Reminds me of the “panel lottery” with TVs. Also with electronics often the issue is due to user error(ignorance) so check out your unit carefully. I’ve yet to have any issue w/ Tribit products and I have several speakers and a pair of headphones. On to this speaker specifically. I’m thrilled . This is upgraded over the one I bought a couple years ago. This has USB-C and seems to charge faster than the old micro-USB version. It also adds an AudioBook mode to its BassBoost button. I gave that old 1 away so I can’t do a side by side comparison yet I loved that too and I know it’s still in use. Seems to me this upgraded version has a tad more clarity. Bass seems the same which is fairly thick and deep without overwhelming the mids and highs. Tribit to my ears has a smooth tube-like sound quality, subtle but present. Keep in mind the bass boost is off when the light is off, on when white but the audio-book mode is on when green and that muffles the sound, much quieter at least for music. I’ll probably never use that mode. This has well balanced high-end sound quality at least w/ my unit. Loud and clean. I own and have heard many other BT speakers. I’ve purchased Anker Soundcore, Doss, Oontz, Marshall, Fender, GGMM, JBL, etc and heard many more. This Tribit is the sound quality champ at $60 or less easily in my experience. Like I said my unit is the anti-lemon, works as intended. Uncertain about battery life yet I’ve been listening all day starting w/ a full charge and still going strong. Build quality is solid, waterproof and easy to grip although it is heavy for its size. I listen to Amazon Music Unlimited HD, so I’m streaming hi-res sources. Even in BT mode I’m hearing CD quality sound which helps bring out the potential of the speaker. Using the Aux line in would give me true hi-res(above CD sound). I refuse to listen to crappy MP3 level sound which most people use so my review is based on a high quality sound source to be fair.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2021",AHAMTKSKGBUHNENM5ZTXAIVX2RPQ,True,2,Color: Black

R125Y9X5FLH8ZW,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I think I like this more than the MaxBoom,Craig S.,5,"First let me say I only recently decided to get Bluetooth speakers. I didn't want to spend a small fortune for them either. Nor did I want to buy a dozen different speakers to find one I would be satisfied with. I watched many reviews on YouTube for budget Bluetooth speakers. JimsReviewRoom and clavinetjunkie are both excellent review sites, and there are some other good ones too. No one seemed to have anything bad to say about Tribit. So I first bought the MaxBoom. I think it's a great speaker. Great sound, just enough volume for me, and well built. Then when the price dropped on the MaxSound, I decided to also purchase this one. Well I think I may like the MaxSound more than the MaxBoom. While the MaxBoom has a little more bass, I think the MaxSound has ""punchier"" bass and the mids and highs are incredibly detailed. It may be because the MaxSound fires directly out the front and the MaxBoom out the sides. The mids and highs just sound cleaner and crisper on the MaxSound. Since you can't connect a MaxSound and a MaxBoom together thru a Bluetooth connection, only a 2 MaxBooms can connect to each other, I decided to combine them both by using them wired to my phone at the same time. I purchased the necessary quality splitter and wires and connected it to a FiiO A3 headphone amplifier to drive a little more ""juice"" to the speakers. WOW it worked better than I expected. With the deeper bass of the MaxBoom added to the punch and crisper highs of the MaxSound, it made a great combination. I set the volume at 100% on my phone and the speakers (you can set each speaker to whatever volume you want using the speakers volume control), and just used the volume control on the FiiO A3. The FiiO A3 has a volume dial from 0(off) thru 9, a high/low gain switch, and a bass boost switch. You need to use the high gain setting. Using the bass boost on the amplifier depends on the volume and what your personal preference is. Setting the volume from 1-3 is mostly useless. 3-4 is a nice low volume with rich sound with the bass boost turned on on the amp (you can still hear someone talking normal). At 4.5-5 things really start to come to life. This is what I would consider a normal listening level. At 5.5-6 they are starting to get loud. 6.5-7.5 they are very loud, but they still sound excellent. 8 is the highest I set it and probably will never go that high again, even outside. Whether I use these individually connected thru a Bluetooth connection, which works very well, or wired to my phone individually or together, I like both of these speakers very much. But I just like the more balanced sound of the MaxSound with those crisp, detailed highs. Though I'm not at all disappointed with either. Just remember where you place the speaker in your room can make a huge difference on how it sounds. Not just these speakers, all speakers. I think both are well made and Tribit has great customer service. Which was extremely important to me.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2019",AEN5K23QP64LF7Y5GNEPAUVFFWFA,True,2,Color: Black
R3DPDRBL6DZPNX,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound in a tiny package,Dani Kittens,5,"I work in a small urgent care medical lab and we currently only have a radio and the local stations are terrible. I decided to get a Bluetooth speaker so we can all have a turn at aux and not have to listen to ads, etc.When I opened the Amazon box I thought there's no way this thing will compete with the instruments in the lab, I'll have to keep it for the bathroom or something. When I opened the actual product box I didn't think it would even be good in the bathroom. Boy was I wrong.Listen, I'm a sound snob. I own the Sony WF-1000XM4 Bluetooth ear buds which are the best on the market. I own high end powered bookshelf speakers. Etc. This little thing is amazing. I cannot get over how good it sounds. I mean is it as great as a high end audio system? No. But for something I could shove in the pocket of my scrubs to carry back and forth to work if I had to, it's absolutely phenomenal.The volume is going to have no issue being heard over our big hematology analyzer, 2 centrifuges, and a bunch of other smaller analyzers. With the extra bass on it puts out respectable bass on all the songs I tried from Brubeck's Take Five to Nine Inch Nail's Discipline. The sound is clear and pretty detailed. There's not much distortion at high volume. There's a little hiss, but what do you want? Even my bookshelf speakers have that.I can't speak to battery life and I don't really care about it, this is going to stay plugged in. Pairing was a breeze. I wish they'd fix Bluetooth in general and just let everything pair infinitely. I'm not sure what difficult it will be to unpair devices. I really only plan to use my phone and have everyone make their own Spotify playlists.Anyhow. Just buy the thing. I'm going to buy two more for at home to pair together to use for watching YouTube videos while I do chores and for music in the shower, etc. Hopefully this thing has a long life ahead of it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AGV6EZKMQOJYKPHTUJFKWJ27633Q,True,21,Color: Blue

R37K1BQL21L8LP,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars One of the best under$100 BT speakers. Recommended. Lowered rating 1 star,bobj90,4,"7-31-2019Lowered rating by 1 star due to the speaker shutting off for no reason after about 1.5-2 hours.Not that big of a deal but I was in the dentist chair and use classical music as my focus sound to reduce my fear of the dentist. The speaker shut off during the 3rd of 4 root canals that were being worked on. The speaker has always shut off after about the same length of time. Irritating when not in the chair, devastating when you are LOL. I know to crank the sending device full volume and control the volume with the BT speaker volume controls. The sound is very good still but that really irritated me. My go to speaker is now the Anker Soundboost. My Ankker Soundcore II died and they sent me the Soundboost free! Not quite as rich in sound of the Tribit at ALL volumes, but does sound better overall because of its full rich bass. And it is slightly louder.The tribit is till top notch and makes a great work desk speaker. The shutting off should cause no problems unless you are using as a speaker for your phone. The Anker Soundboost also works better for speaker phone use.The richness of sound and the fullness of the bass makes for a great listening experience. Calvinetjunkie turned me onto this one! I just recently bought the LG PK3 (Very good speaker), and the Anker Soundcore II speakers. Love the LG but it is very sensitive to placement. I like to suspend the speaker above and in front of where I am sitting working. Bass booms.The Anker blew me away when I FIRST heard it. It seems to have lost the deep rich bass and clean sound it had at the very first. Or, did the Tribit simply ""ruin"" my ears for listening to the SCII?Battery lasts as long as advertised which is nice to see.The speaker has what some reviewers refer to as ""gimmicky"": a bass boost button. I do not believe this speakers bass boost button is a gimmick. If you have any experience with BT speakers and compressed music, you know that the bass can be exaggerated and less bass is needed. Turn off the BB. When listening to some music at low volume, the bass can get lost. Turn on the BB.Very well built with sticky feet which prevent it from diving off ledges when you crank it up. It also tilts back on two feet which can help the sound. It does not have to fight the reflection of sound from a hard surface directly in front of the drivers when tilted back.The speaker can handle a lot of bass even at high volumes which is impressive. Above 70%-75% the bass does start to lessen to prevent distortion/farting. Starts to sound a little harsh, but there is no distortion!When I use only one BT speaker, it is now the Tribit!I own and use a pair Onyx Studio IIs; a pair of OontZ Angle 3XL Ultras; a pair of OontZ Angle 3 Ultras, LG PK 3; JBL Clip; and an Anker Soundcore II.This Tribit speaker is better than ANY Bose BT speaker under $200.

RPUQ4ESSLBHUM,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit holds its own for half the price vs Bose Micro and JBL Flip 5,R. A. Maynard,5,"For these tests I placed the speakers about 20 feet away (in my garage) and compared 3 different musical genres (Metal, Hip-Hop, and Jazz) using 2 iPhone Xr's and Apple Music on both. I played the segments of same songs, back to back, comparing what I heard. Both phones were set up identically - so only the speakers were different. Here is what I observed:Tribit MaxSound Plus vs Bose Soundlink Micro: The speakers sounded a little different from each other, but both sounded very good. It was hard to define the difference, and I could not say if I preferred one over the other - they were different, but good. The max volume level on both seemed to be the same - the each produced the same overall volume of sound and they each sounded great at max volume. Either one could be used in my standard two car garage to ""fill"" the room with good, high quality sounding music. Neither of the speakers sounded tiny or cheap. The Bose Micro is much smaller overall, and includes the nifty strap that can be used to attach the speaker to things like bike handlebars, etc. But, the Bose also needs to be leaned against something or laid on it's back (with the sound being directed toward the sky) when not using the strap to strap to something.Tribit MaxSound Plus vs the JBL Flip 5: These two speakers are almost identical in size and in ""feel"". The flip 5 has an overall more ""round"" tubular shape without an obvious front, whereas the Tribit has a more traditional shape and front side. Doing the same test as above, I had almost the same results. However, in this case - the JBL was notably louder at the max volume. Not a lot louder - but definitely noticeably louder. However - at half the price, I'd choose the Tribit, for any scenario. Like the JBL (and Bose) the Tribit is basically water proof and sand proof and seems very well made. The tribit also boasts a 20 hour battery and 100 foot Bluetooth radius (although I have not verified these, it seems pretty accurate).All things considered, I think the Tribit is easily the most bang for the buck, although the Bose Micro is much smaller and has a nifty strap that can be used to strap to certain things (like bike handle bars) and the JBL is a little louder at max volume. All three speakers sound great, albeit different from one another. All three are plenty loud and ""full"" enough for an average 2 car garage or any room in a home. All are plenty adequate for small outdoor gatherings as well - although maybe not for a large parties.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2020",AHERHE2YV464S5PCUGX2SB5EZJIA,True,1,Color: Black
R3MLGSY10URWZY,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasantly Surprised!,Miya,5,"So, I live in a condo on the ground floor, and have an older upstairs neighbor who claims to ""lose sleep"" over *any* sounds coming from my unit - once, he even went so far to gift me with some ancient over-the-ear headphones to listen to my TV (complete with a 4' cord and a Radio Shack-era connection jack). Not only do I listen to terrible 90s industrial music, I like it somewhat loud... the electronic shrieking and hammering and horror movie sampling, God, I love it. I was looking for a speaker that I could connect to my phone via Bluetooth that would have decent sound quality, but not evoke the wrath of the grumpy homie upstairs. After doing some comparisons, and also taking into consideration that I was going to use my ex-boyfriend's $50 gift card, this Tribit MaxSound seemed to get pretty solid reviews, so I cackled, ""If you're going to leave me from a heroin-addicted prostitute, well, I'M going to get a speaker!"" and placed the order. The speaker was nicely packaged and included the USB charging cable and an AUX cable, and I was impressed at the weight of the unit itself. I have two maniacal demons living in my house that pretend to be cats, and they like to knock stuff over (while looking deep into the depths of my soul) when I'm trying to relax. I charged it up for about an hour and gave it a go with Front 242's ""Headhunter,"" the song I've christened every new audio device I've had since 1989. This song is not light on bass, and even on ""vanilla"" (normal) mode, it sounded pretty good at 50% volume. I selected the Bass EQ setting and while I wouldn't say it was thumpin', it was impressively rich for such a small unit. I eventually turned things up to 100% volume, and wow, it filled my 15'x12' great room surprisingly well, with no distortion. It's loud enough on its own, but now I'm hoping my neighbor will move (like he's threatened to do for the last 10 years) and I can get a second unit to experience the true stereo sound.

R3RDMJNTDCPA4A,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect - Very Nice Speaker,Mikel1976,4,"I really like this speaker and want to give it 5 stars. Maybe I'll change it to 5 stars (originally I had it at 4). If I could pick 4 1/2 stars I would. I love everything about the speaker except for having to push the play button 2 times to skip next and 3 times to skip back. Most of the time it does work, but sometimes I end up pausing the song or going forward when I want to go back. The sound is really good. This Tribit MaxSound Plus is louder, clearer, has more bass and is better sounding than my Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, which is a good thing because it's bigger and cost $20 more. I recently purchased this speaker (the Tribit), the oontz Angle 3 Ultra and the Anker SoundCore2. I tested and compared all 3 speakers in different environments. My end goal was to have a great shower speaker that I rarely have to charge. The Soundcore2 was great, but the Oontz was better for clarity and overall sound. The Soundcore2 really did sound good, but I decided in the end that it had a piercing quality that my ears found a little uncomfortable at high volume. As for the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, I don't like that the Oontz controls are on the end instead of the top. I found I really have to turn the speaker and look at it to switch songs, which is annoying, however, I also found that if I keep the speaker firing away from me with easy access to the side controls, it actually sounds just as good or better and I can see the controls, which include seek forward and seek back. In the end, I think the Oontz will end up being my shower speaker due to the controls. The Tribit Wins for best sound, especially in the shower. It just sounds wonderful and has more volume than I will ever use in the shower. If I have any complaint on sound, I feel it's missing some midrange. I've noticed only a few times that I feel I'm missing some of the middle tones in some songs, but then maybe I'm over analyzing. Overall, I just love the speaker and wish I had more opportunities to use it. It sounds better in any environment than the others, but because I skip songs a lot and replay them a lot and it doesn't have dedicated buttons to do this, I can't see using it as my everyday speaker. Comparing it to the Oontz and the Anker is really not fair, because it's just a different class really. It's definitely worth the extra $20. I had originally planned on keeping only one speaker, but I can't bring myself to return this. If you want something that really thumps with good bass and good highs and you don't mind the controls, then I think this is a Great choice and a great value.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2019",AEP5DCNVC3SVDHKD5GX6OFATQGHA,True,8,Color: Black

R2E9PH2NE1KNLE,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars My second blue tooth speaker, so far it's quite good!",Tom H.,5,"I got this speaker for listening to in the bedroom while exercising and out on the deck when catching some rays. My first experience with bluetooth speakers was with a teeny Altec Lansing model - roughly half the size of this and a third of the weight. It's a hefty brute! I loved being able to offload my listening from the built-in iPhone 12 speaker I first started using (which doesn't sound that bad, BTW), and wanted something that sounded a little louder and was still better sounding overall. This speaker fit the bill quite nicely. It has a bass boost feature that I have simply left on, as it provided a nice punch to bass sounds, without overwhelming the rest of the music. The battery doesn't last as long as I would like though - after about 3 hours at about 1/3 volume and with the bass boost on, it drops to approx. 50% from an initial full charge. If I had been using it for, say, a party or social gathering lasting longer than that, I could see it running out of charge too soon. So keep that in mind. Still not bad, since I don't have such gatherings,, but it has led me to charge it after every use basically, which is a bit annoying. Given the quality of the sound and seeming good construction quality, overall I'm still quite satisfied. I bought the carrying case for this at the same time as well, which was also quite good and recommended.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AEMH3VIUIGJ363MNQUQAF734MMXA,True,3,Color: Black

There are 3 built-in EQ options but none of them give a balanced sound like the go's have. Yes, it has more bass and will play louder for sure, but the sound quality/balance isn't as good.Around $50, I think this is just an ok speaker, unlike the go's which are great for their price point.If you mostly listen on the high side of volume, it might be ok for you.

This should work pretty well, though it won't be as loud as some of my coworkers job-site radios. Of course, I would like it to be louder, but I can't take a star away for unmet/unrealistic expectations.The sound quality is outstanding and has a nice even flat-ish EQ to it. That's important to me as a musician and someone who has done recording/mixing before. I'll probably not use the bass boost that often listening to music, though maybe I will while watching movies for a bigger sound.Compared to the X Sound Go, the Plus is only marginally louder, but it is much more full sounding even without the bass boost turned on. In the world of sound/power, it takes 10x the wattage to get a 3db gain in volume (a perceived doubling of the volume), so going from 12 watts in the X Sound Go to 24 watts in the Plus isn't going to yield much more volume. If you're familiar with guitar, I would say it is the difference between playing through a Fender Princeton and a Deluxe Reverb. Not much louder, just bigger sounding.Overall I'm impressed with the sound, and it can't be touched for the price!!","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2023",AFJJRTRQKN5PTHRY3JYJHJKST5YA,True,14,Color: Black

Videos won’t route audio half the time, bluetooth connection will override AUX-in even in silence, and the only way to know that you’re really changing the volume is with the buttons on the speaker. They control your device volume but sometimes using your device as a media remote will fail for volume control. The EQ modes are fun, Battery life seems good and I appreciate the USBC port! I also like that this speaker is stereo even though it’s on the more compact side. Not the best L/R definition since the drivers are fairly close together but it beats mono for me generally!

RS9L1VD50BFBD,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Earned my Respect,Carolyn Wilburn,5,"I rarely rate purchased items of any kind, but the quality of the Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker and Tribit's customer service have earned my respect, my time, and five stars. For those of you looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that holds its charge at least all night long, can be easily packed for travel, and sounds just fine for its size, the Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker should at least be a finalist in your smaller Bluetooth speaker selection process. Before purchasing my Tribit, I had a larger Bluetooth speaker of a different brand that sounds splendid, but I needed a smaller one for travel. The Tribit MaxSound Plus has proven to be a perfect fit, solidly build, and of decent weight--it is not a cheap piece of junk, but interestingly engineered with both hardware and software to produce good sound. I purchased my first Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker, which worked flawlessly, more than a year ago, then gave it to my daughter who travels more than I. I replaced it with a second Tribit MaxSound Plus. Unfortunately, that speaker was faulty. I arranged with customer service to have it replaced. The replacement speaker arrived, but it too would not work, at least at first. Customer service and I speculated that the problem was the charging wire, and sent me a new one. That did not immediately solve the problem. Thinking the speaker was frozen, like a PC will freeze occasionally, I let the speaker completely drain of power, then I completely recharged it. That draining/charging process did reset the speaker and it now works fine. For you future Tribit owners, please be aware that this resolution is not in Tribit's instruction manual. Reset instructions there ask you to press the up and down volume buttons simultaneously, which for my purposes did nothing. A final comment to share concerns the charging wire. Be sure to color code it so you will know which way is up when you plug it into the speaker. Otherwise, it is easy to mistakenly try to put it in upside down; do that enough and you will shorten the life of your charging wire or damage the speaker part the charging wire fits onto. I extend my congratulations to Tribit's engineers and to Tribit's customer service. Your product sounds good, you were easy to contact, and you worked with me to resolve my issues. The end result is blissful sound--good things take time but the best ones also sound good.","Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2020",AGPLOEXZGBTQUW5UO3RSO5YPPUNA,True,0,Color: Black

They did not demand that I returned the broken one either stating, ""since you have already been inconvenienced and we value your time. Simply discard the previous unit no need to send it back"" [slight paraphrasing there].I will say that I was impressed with their interest in my situation and their immediate solution oriented response. Buy with confidence with Tribit. If you have problems they will be there for you.

R3MJ6N19592NZT,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Sound, Rivals Bigger Speakers",Amazon Customer,5,"Blown away by the sound quality of the Tribit Maxsound. Deep resonant bass, full mids and clear highs, very well integrated, sounding more like a home hi fi system than a portable speaker. Battery life is so far good, on my second day of playing it for hours, still at 50%. I've had the less powerful predecessor, the X Sound Go, and while that one was excellent, this one has even more clarity and much more powerful bass, with an added bass radiator in the back. The X Bass mode sounds best, deep and full, but nice to have the option to have less bass in situations where someone nearby might be disturbed, or it's not required eg. light bedtime music, classical, ambient. Phenomenal speaker, can't say enough about the sound quality. I have other larger speakers and this one makes as much or more bass. Has a premium feel, very solid build and easy on the eyes. Haven't tested the IPX7 rating but videos on YouTube show this speaker playing under water no problem. At this price you can't go wrong. Only thing I would change, would be nice if the speaker could be paired in stereo then I'd buy another one. You still could pair them with two Aux cords and a splitter. Wouldn't be left right stereo but would still sound good. Stereo and sound separation is excellent. The Tribit sounds much bigger than it is. Google incorrectly says this speaker doesn't have an aux input, it does. Bluetooth pairing is fast, good solid connection and range. There's really nothing else this size, at this price, that sounds this good. Even sounds better than speakers twice the size and price. It's a joy to listen to this speaker, such a smooth, rich and well balanced sound. Compared to new Bugani Shock, upgraded version of the M83, the Tribit is more clear, and has deeper bass at low volume. The sound quality is superb. Fantastic speaker. Sounds better than comparable JBL speakers as well, even the larger ones. Other speakers sound either tinny or muffled compared to the Tribit. Buy it now and be happy.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AGXAZR2ELUNBJ7FF5XDDEPFCQSKA,True,4,Color: Black
RB8D8IPW344QA,B07MQWG3PR,2.0 out of 5 stars Pick your poison: Muddy highs or anemic bass,J S,2,"I bought this after my absolute satisfaction with Tribit's Stormbox vertically-standing speaker, which has it all: Great highs, deep bass when you turn on the bass boost, and generally solid battery lift.That product no longer available to me, I picked up this ThunderBox thinking, ""Heck, it's almost got the same name, surely it's just as good, right?!""Wrong.Pairing and bluetooth range may be an ounce better on this unit, but the sound quality is an issue, and from a company that usually hits it out of the park for me, a self-admitted audio snob.Without bass boost on, the mids and highs sound good, normal, what you'd expect. The bass response, however, to say it was ""lackluster"" would be kind, and also incorrect. The only word to really describe it is ""anemic"". Mind you, the StormBox isn't great without bass boost, but this ... this ThunderBox is bad.Something weird with bass boost on, though ... the highs get muddy and dull. Almost like putting bass boost on activates a cap/filter that chops off everyhing above 8,000-10,000 Hz or something. Like, all brightness from the highs disappears, and it drags the sound down.I will say, it's great in the typical Tribit ways: Good battery life. Rock-solid bluetooth connectivity with all devices, computer and smartphone. Nice appearance. Very portable. It's just the sound. I hate to say it, but it kinda sucks in comparison to previous Tribit headphones and other bluetooth speakers from their past, like the StormBox.So my advice? If you're buying this to replace your tired StormBox, DON'T. You'll be disappointed. I'd wait at least another product generation to see if they can iron out the wrinkles in that one. This speaker is ultimately going into our camping box, to be used in a pinch, when there's no other option.I'm disappointed with Tribit on this one.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2024",AGBPNJL46RD5XNLJP75UGPR4D4GQ,True,0,
R12MEWZ687A3V1,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Reliable, with loud, clear sound",Jen H (and sometimes Mr H :-)),5,"Radio reception in our area is abysmal, so I always listen to the radio via my computer. I am at home during the day and listen to talk radio (NPOR, the BBC) and audiobooks all day long, carrying the speaker around with me the speaker around with me. I've gone through a number of speakers - so,me good, some bad. Before this one, I had a Deck speaker that I also liked, and which was slightly more compact, but that is no longer being produced. I really like the Tribit speaker. I find the sound really clear and the range very good indeed. I rarely listen to music, so I can't really testify as to what extent it will satisfy those who are very discriminating concerning music output, but my spouse, who does listen to music, hasn't yet complained. We have a 2,000 sq ft fixer-upper home and the Tribit connection works throughout the house. (Unlike the blinkin cellphones!) It does lose the connection if I take it down the garden to the dustbins, but so have all my previous speakers, and I normally use my refurbished ""professional"" Logitech headphones outside anyway, in order not to be a public nuisance! (I prefer not to use headphones all the time.) The Tribit It comes with a short, cord-like wrist strap, but I've attached a brightly colo(u)red lanyard to it, to make it easier to grab and also locate if I go out and forget where I left it.. :-) If the computer powers down, the speaker turns itself off fairly quickly to conserve battery power and since I invariably leave the house in a mad rush, I find this a very helpful feature, too.In my experience, if you're going to use a Bluetooth speaker regularly, it's better not to opt for the cheapest ones. Not only because the sound quality will usually be poorer, but also because in normal use, rather than in the lab, the range is rarely as good as the maximum range claimed, and if, like me, you're clumsy and drop them, it tends to get worse! Although the Tribit handbook recommends NOT dropping it (surprise, surprise!) mine has survived several such episodes. Though I wish, nonetheless, that it came with a protective case, or offered one as an optional extra.The Tribit speaker was a gift from my husband, who knows more about these things. But I am really happy with it and am very glad he selected this one!","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2019",AGFT7YIPZHYJ4IULGIKONJJJCUPQ,True,0,Color: Black
R12EYF3QHE85WR,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Terrific sound and brief speaker comparison,scjr,5,"I own an original XSound Go and two XBoom’s, which I can daisy chain. I’ve been impressed with every speaker Tribit has released up until this point and this new MaxSound Plus is no exception.The Plus has a well balanced, neutral and pleasing sound. It’s the improved big brother of the Go. The Plus is slightly larger in size and definitely heavier. When you hold both in your hands, you can definitely feel the difference in weight. I think the Go would be a better option portability wise. The Plus has rugged hard rubber exterior. Build quality is excellent.The MaxSound gets plenty loud enough, but the most important point to mention—the music is well balanced. No scratchy treble or booming notes that are out of place in the sound signature. Just a well rounded sound. I think it’s important to note: Make sure you turn on the XBass feature, as this feature enhances the overall sound and adds a fuller note, especially at lower levels. You can listen to this speaker for hours without being fatigued.I was introduced to the Tribit brand by clavinetjunkie’s YouTube channel. Oluv’s channel is great, because he focuses on quality of sound—not just how loud a speaker gets. Overall loudness, for the most part, doesn’t always equal great sound. I recommend you check out his channel. It will definitely help in your search for speakers.My short take on each Tribit speaker I own:XSound Go:Still sounds great.Best for portability.Lowest price point.MaxSound Plus:Sounds the best.Improved larger version of Go.Mid price point.XBoom:Sounds great. 360 sound.Ability to daisy chain two speakers.Highest price point.Just choose one of the speakers that matches your price point or listening environment. This MaxSound and their other speakers are an excellent value to price. There isn’t a compelling reason to purchase an overpriced name brand, with inferior sound quality.I posted several pictures of the MaxSound and my other Tribit speakers for size comparison. You can see the size difference between the Go and the Plus. I purchased all of these speakers, except for one of the XBoom’s I won in a contest. My personal experience with the Tribit brand has been positive. This MaxSound Plus is definitely a keeper.EDIT: This is just a heads up for anyone suffering random shutdowns with their MaxSound Plus. I had this issue and Tribit provided me with a firmware that corrected the issue. Great support from Tribit. Just email Tribit and they will send you the firmware.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2019",AGOHYHPEY4D6UKYJB6KFVORX5MXA,True,26,Color: Black

The buttons are solid and responsive.I was blown away with the sound! I love the bass and EQ, and I think it has a richer, more balanced sound than the Pill. In fact, I think it sounds better than any other Bluetooth speaker I've ever owned. I find that 60% volume is more than enough for enjoyable, awesome, room-filling sound.I also love the tilt feature.

R2EY3BFRSFK7H8,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent choice,SomeRandomChad,5,"This thing is great. I don't like poor sounding tunes, they won't be tolerated in my presence. This speaker delivers.Sound - this speaker has full and dynamic range. Reaches good highs and deep enough lows. I was initially confused by the bass button - of course I want the bass! - but while using it and responsibly talking with some friends from a distance, I found it was helpful to turn just the bass down. I don't usually do this, but it's actually a nice feature.Volume - My last blutooth speaker blew the woofer on 4th of July while getting our freedom on. This speaker is easily 4x as loud (and 3x the price). At near max volume, it sounds great too. It's easily loud enough to fill a backyard and be heard with kids screaming. It's easily too loud for anywhere indoors unless you're getting wild. At low volume, the bass can be a little more loud than it needs to be (muddy) so you might push the button to turn the bass down.Range - Seems to be pretty good. I've only had my phone about 20ft from it and it didn't skip a beat.Battery - It'll blast the beats for at least 8 hours (that's about the longest I've had it running). I've used it about 15 times for 30 minutes each on a single charge (at low volume). I haven't yet pushed it hard enough to kill the battery. So i'd say it's pretty good.Size - About the size of a 16oz can of delicious brewskie. Twice the weight. I still use a much smaller (wallet sized) speaker for more personal use such as when hiking/mtn biking. This big boi goes to the pool with us, on the back patio, and in the garage all the time.Bonus - I chose this based on some online reviews AND that it's directional - meaning the speakers all face one direction. This means I can focus music to where i want it playing. For me, this was important. If you want omnidirectional music, this doesn't exactly do that.- Cheers","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020",AHJ6YRAQNQN74LNSQAZM5SIGJNGA,True,1,Color: Black
R1X24MR50HMXG5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic travel speaker at great value,Godwin,5,"I have gone through several portable speakers in my quest to find a great all purpose travel speaker that I can take on my Business or leisure trips. The 2 most recent ones are the Bose Mini Soundlink and the Vifa Helsinki.Bose soundlink mini is ok for music, but terrible for spoken word/podcast because of its boomy sound. It’s almost unusable.The Vifa Helsinki is one of the best portable Bluetooth speaker, with very detailed sound. At home it is able to match with my homepods, home theatre speakers and studio monitors when I am playing music via airplay. (Vifa Helsinki connected via Aux to an Airport Express which can receive Airplay 2).However, it is too big to travel with, And rather heavy. It greatly increases my carry on luggage weight.I came across this brand on the YouTube channel Oluv’s Gadgets. It provides detailed comparisons and reviews of all kinds of Bluetooth/portable speakers. The Tribit Maxsound Plus compared rather favourably to other more well known more expensive brands. For $50 it was a no brainer to try.I am very satisfied with this speaker. It’s a small travel speaker. And despite its diminutive size, it produces respectable clarity and bass. If anyone is going to use this as their primary speaker, please don’t. Get something bigger like the Vifa Helsinki. For podcasts and generally listening to music, this speaker produces very pleasing sound.For $50 (or even $60) this is extremely good value, at a great size as it fits nicely in even a small backpack.As a travel speaker, I have absolutely no complaints. It has very good highs, mids and bass. Placing it near a wall or a corner enhances the sound quite a bit.They claim water resistance so I use it in the bathroom as well. Definite plus for outdoor use.The battery life is great, I have not had to worry about charge but I do plug it in every 3-4 days after listening to it for a couple of hours everyday.And it charges via USB which is great, the Vifa needs a bulky power adapter.I would have never paid attention to this brand were it not for the review and comparison I watched on YouTube. I usually only buy relatively high end speakers (the Helsinki cost me $400) and by default I would dismiss any sub $100 speaker. But I gave this a shot and am very pleased.As small travel speakers, I highly recommend this.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2019",AHA5RITWO32E3EZE2FBXD2EWZSGA,True,21,Color: Black

If you are looking for a speaker to play outside by the pool you probably need something else. (look at Ultimate ears or JBL.

R1H7W2RZZA62EF,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Saved $100+ by not getting JBL/Bose speaker,Rick Lyon,5,"I was looking at the JBL Charge 3/4, UE Mega Boom and the Bose soundlink that were all around $125-$150. I couldn't make up my mind on sound quality among those 3 and I was trying to justify the price for several times a month that I would need to use the speaker. I decided to keep researching and came across this never-heard-of unit which Amazon is notorious for carrying. I read the reviews and for the price decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did!For less than a thrid of the cost of the models I was looking at, I am super happy with the Tribit. It comes in a simple box and not much else. Nothing fancy. However, the sound is very nice and it had some great bass for the price, size and compared to the models I was looking at. I listen to all types of music but I listen mostly to hip hop, R&B, electronica, etc that require bass to hear anything from the sound. This delivers. The bass is great, no complaints. It's not deep bass obviously, but it's not tincup sounding and produces a decent range. The mids and highs are clear. The JBL was too harsh on the high range for me, and both the Bose and UE favored the mids too much. The Tribit was well balanced. It doesn't exceed at anything, but it's not muddy either.For battery life, I haven't charged it yet. I've had it for about 2 months, used it for about 4-6 hours 3 times and then a few extra times at less than an hour or so each time. So less than 20 hours so far but I haven't charged it yet so I'm happy it seems to be lasting.So to sound just as good, if not slightly better for a 3rd of the price is a definite score. I haven't put it through all the paces and done any scientific type research on it, I just know it satisfied my love for bass, has decent sound overall and comes in at a great price.

Either they got a bad one, and that happens with every brand and you can usually get a replacement, they are just ignorant or stupid. You are not going to get better sound on something this size for $60 and probably not even for $100. As for power, if you are outside you are not going to here it very well if you are 20' away. If you are in a smaller room, sitting on a porch or patio or have it near you on a table you will have plenty of volume but don't expect it to compete with bluetooth boxes that have much larger speakers. There is plenty of bass if you have the XBass button on. I can't say exactly how many hours you get out of the battery because I usually only use it for a short while at a time but I can go quite a while before needing to charge it so I will assume the battery life is close to what they say it is.

R3FI5D98JUM4VB,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound However Needs Improvement,Joanne,3,"I received this speaker literally 6 hours ago. This small speaker (with the xbass on) packed a real punch for its small size. In addition, the battery seemed to last a while considering how I used it for about 4 hours straight and the battery didn’t drop that much. I used this speaker to sit on the sink counter and listen to music while I showered. I noticed that the volume was pretty loud despite my phone being 30-40% volume which is great! When I got out of the shower I switched the speaker back into my computer and it was still wonderful! However after I paused my music I realized that there was a static noise coming from the speaker when the music stop. It would then play a high pitch noise and then stop playing noise entirely. Note that this speaker was is not damaged, I didn’t drop it or get it wet. So I thought maybe it was the Bluetooth connection. I haven’t figured out the static issue of this speaker, but I noticed that the USB-C charging port is loose and makes a clicking noise when wiggled.TL;DRPros:- Amazing bass! With the xbass on, the bass was super good (granted it doesn’t sound that full, but the for the size of the speaker it’s super good!)- Loud volume. Granted speakers are supposed to be loud, but I’m surprised how loud it was given its size.- Pretty good battery life so far! Stayed at 40% for the 4 hours of use!Cons:- Became staticky after 4 hours of usage. It could be an issue with my Bluetooth, but I’m not entirely sure. I connected it to my iPhone and it was still staticky.- The USB-C port moves a lot. Granted it still charges, but I’m afraid that the port will wear down quickly.Final thoughts:I will sleep on this, and let the speaker charge up some more and hope that it somehow fixes itself in the morning.Update:Customer support is phenomenal! I sent a ticket in at around 1am and received an email back at 1:20am. That response time is incredible (they’re stationed in Germany so it was around 8am for them)! I told them about the static noise and they told me ways to fix the problem and offered a $7 refund (I bought this without the $6 coupon because it wasn’t available at that time).","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AGGE7NMHAIAIVGK2WECD4ZTWAU7Q,True,5,Color: Black

In fact I bought a second maxsound plus. While there's no app to tweak the sound you do get two EQs basically normal and bass up. Prefer bass up. The added bass has depth, isn't boomy and doesn't overwhelm the mids and highs. The sound is nicely balanced and easy to listen to. It sounds full at both low volume and turned up. It can fill up a medium sized space. Pairing two gives you true stereo and even better sound. Now these are fairly small speakers and the bass while quite impressive will not hit you in the chest so be real about expectations. I also own a Soundcore Motion +. As a stand alone it is better than a single Tribit. But using two in stereo the sound stage is different but comparable and sometimes preferred. Two Tribits and a single Soundcore cost roughly the same. (Around $100). A single Maxsound Plus is very capable, well-built, excellent battery and at about $50 a bargain.

At lower volume it sound OK, you need to use the Bass booster to make the sound fuller. But when used outside or larger space and mid or high volume that's when this thing really excels. The dynamic range is there, but the tone, is very good. When you hear the bass (instrument) is not only the low end but you actually ear the mid bass range, that is hard to listen in any other Bluetooth speaker, the bass doesn't exist or get too boom. I call it fake bass.This thing really plays well with different styles. Mid and high don't get crunchy at high volume, and voice sound very natural.My only complain would be that while charging with my computer it create a static noise, this is a common issue with this type of speakers.

The Angle 3 got impressively loud, but always lacked a substantial kick unless placed on a specific kind of surface (I found the floor tom of my drum kit works great, but try lugging that into the office).I found out about the MaxSound Plus a week or so before it became available, and with Tribit’s website giving me 30% off for signing up to get notified upon release, I thought it was a bargain.A couple hours into listening to this speaker and I can assuredly say it’s worth the money, even if you do pay full price; I would have gladly splurged $50 on this thing (with my coupon, I paid around $35).It is a small speaker, but the heft of it is satisfying. The normal mode does have a pronounced low end - nothing to make your heart thump, but it’s rock solid for a small speaker (I would say better than the Beats Pill+‘s soulless knock). Turning the XBass on is the equivalent feeling of popping your ears; it’s a rush of new frequencies you forgot you appreciated so much.The battery life seems legit, as I’ve been listening to music and podcasts at moderate levels for the last two hours, and the battery meter hasn’t visibly gone down - it came out of the box with a 60% charge.I do like that the volume is synchronized with my phone, so I don’t have to worry about what volume which device is at before playing. I live in a small apartment, and the connectivity has been flawless so far. The only thing I found strange is this speaker doesn’t take kindly to quick changes in volume - i.e. when I use the volume slider on my phone to ramp the sound up quickly, the speaker tends to stammer and lag a little bit. This is totally something I can deal with, but I’ve never heard another speaker act like this.Bottom line though, the sound is brilliant for a small speaker, and I’m looking forward to months if not years of enjoyment out of this little guy.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2019",AH2U3MPSHQKNTSGOHRQDUCOQRZOQ,True,91,Color: Black
R1C0QZPAP4I7VN,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars A Mighty Mite of a Speaker, A Real Overachiever!",Arrowsmith47,5,"This device is well made. The shell seems to be metallic and is quite heavy. The manufacturer has built it with great care. The front grille is sturdy and seems to be a composite material, it is a winner so far. This speaker is quite heavy for its size which speaks to the battery inside it. The initial charge was stated to require 4hrs with normal USB current. Stated operation on a charge is 20 hrs. The business end consists of two speakers of approx 2inches in diameter. They deliver treble an mid range sound. Between them is a woofer of about 2inches by 1 inch in a rounded horizontal format. This bass speaker has sound vents to the rear of the device. Bluetooth pairing and connection were easily accomplished. The range of this connection exceeds the distance available in my house. Walls and doors were not a problem. I tested this speaker with my test playlist on Amazon music. Loud rock, and soft classical. Soprano, and Bass singers. I have listened to a variety of Sirius channels. I do the with every set of earbuds, earphones a speaker I have bought in the last 5 years. This diminutive portable set out performs the built in speakers in my iPad, my Galaxy S10, and the good Logitech speakers I use with my computer. Indeed it performs as well as I can hear. The bass is really good, especially when you use the bass expansion or “X” button. Within the limits of my hearing, the treble and mid range are more than I expected. I am pleased with the volume, an quality of the output. The manufacturer is to be complemented on a well made and high performing portable speaker. I received this device inside 24hours, it arrived in a well fixed inner box. It includes a aux cable, and a standard USB charging cable. However both are quite short an light gauge plastic coated wire. My cat loves plastic wire insulation, so I am using 3rd party fabric cables of much heavier gauge. This is literally the only gripe I could find about this speaker. Glad I bought this one.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2019",AHWCAL3UU7RWMKLDBL6C72KKDDUA,True,12,Color: Black
R27ORTAMS5OGT0,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the upgrade, probably",Leez,5,"While the shape of both the original speaker and this speaker is still a little unfortunate for car use, I definitely don't regret buying the original XSound or upgrading to this one after the previous one died to years of rough treatment from me. This one is much louder, and has an excellent bass boost setting.Apparently it also has an audiobook setting as well, but I have no clue how audiobooks sound on it as I don't listen to them. I definitely think Tribit is the best ""budget"" audio brand out there right now and none of their products have ever disappointed me. It is a little heavier and larger than I expected, so if you plan to carry it around casually for some reason, it might be more reasonable to go with the smaller model.Unfortunately, the bass boost setting does seem to eat battery life much faster than the regular setting, but it's still a respectable battery life all the same.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AEMXIBNLULLSWNOBL2BKTARKCONQ,True,3,Color: Black
R3546FDHU8XXNK,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Well worth the money!,larryf1952,5,"I was looking for a bluetooth speaker to use with my phone while I worked in different parts of the house, or while doing tasks where it was not convenient to listen to my computer. This would be my first BT speaker, so I was flying sort of blind. I didn't want to spend a lot straight out of the gate, but I wanted something that sounded better than an old transistor radio. This little Tribit MaxSound Plus has hit the jackpot.I did a LOT of research and listened to a LOT of reviews. Everywhere that I went, people had good things to say about the Tribit. I ordered one, and I have been extremely satisfied with the quality of sound that comes out of this little box. Having said that, one must remember that it cannot rewrite the laws of physics. It's still a tiny box, with tiny speakers. One must not expect it to perform above its physical limitations. Within those limitations, though, it performs admirably.I set the Tribit up and paired it with my old Samsung S6. It connected in just a few seconds. I pulled up Pandora and began to listen to some smooth jazz. I was immediately struck by how the mids punched through. Snare hits and guitar riffs were up front and accurate. Vocals were crisp and clean, without any warbling or perceptible distortion. In the ""extra bass"" mode, the bass notes came through accurately and without overpowering the rest of the music. At max volume, the bass suffers a bit, but still sounds great for the size of the box. The dynamic range of this little speaker, for a price of under $50, does in itself almost defy the laws of physics.I had ordered another manufacturer's speaker at the same time that I ordered the Tribit, because it, too, had had good reviews. It did not hold a candle to the Tribit. It was AWFUL. It sounded as if the musicians were playing inside a tin can, inside a cardboard box. It's going back.If you're looking for a decent BT speaker just to have around, without breaking the bank, try the Tribit. You'll get WAY more than you spent.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2019",AFLJAID65ESVK2PC45Z567OK2QDQ,True,17,Color: Black
R2Y2RAVMCLKLUU,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars How is it possible to get this sound for $50.00?,Gilly Girl,5,"I have bought several out door speakers to use at my pool. No matter what they promise; long battery life, clear sound, easy to use etc none of them have done what they promise. Blue tooth cuts in and out ,battery dies after a couple of hours , takes 10 minutes to get it to pair the list goes on and on. So I thought what the heck , I am going to buy a cheap speaker since every summer I struggle with the high dollar ones I have.Nothing is worse than a great album playing and boom your speaker dies or cuts out. So this was my choice and it is unbelievable you can get a product that sounds like this for the price. First , I am not very electronically savvy , so when I can hook up and pair a speaker in 5 minutes that is pretty remarkable my #1 reason for wanting to kiss the manufacturer of this product is ease of use - Just plug it in, charge it, pair it and boom your done. #2 the sound is amazing. Even at low level I can hear it from across the backyard and it is nice clear sound, not this cut in and out sound that I am use to. #3 The freakin battery lasted from when I turned it on at 10am until I turned it off at 7pm that night, and still had charge the next day! Therefore I am totally thrilled with my little speaker. My husband, who can find something wrong with everything , even said "" wow, that is some speaker""how much did you pay for that??So if you want a speaker for around $50.00 that sounds like one that cost $250 buy this speaker!

R1L49YM1JSRYWN,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars A partial step up from the Tribit Go,EmbeddedFlyer,3,"I also have the smaller Tribit Go and this plays louder and has even more bass but isn't as impressive overall given the bigger size and price. The bass in normal mode is far less than the Go and with the extended bass feature turned on it has more bass than the Go but it's a bit more boomy and less natural than the Go.If you're after louder more room filling sound this is the better choice but there are likely other bluetooth speakers in this price range that may do even better although they will probably be larger. For it's size the MaxSound is fairly impressive.The specified battery life is 20 hours versus 24 hours for the Go. In practice it depends greatly on the volume level for both. If you push the MaxSound hard you'll be lucky to get 4 hours. In real world use the Go seems to run significantly longer on a charge.Like the Go it sounds fairly good with a relatively balanced sound with some extra bass punch. I think the mids and highs on the Go sound a bit better. The MaxSound also suffers from what's known as inter-modulation distortion which is the technical way of saying the bass mucks up the mids and highs at higher volumes. This is common with single full range drivers as used here. Better designs use a ""subwoofer"" for the deeper bass to avoid the distortion but they will be larger and not as portable.But both Tribit speakers sound WAY better than most of the no-name Chinese brands with their over boosted fatiguing highs and fake boomy bass. The build quality is also excellent. Both Tribit speakers are solid, heavy, have no buzzes or rattles, and the controls work well. Both seem to connect well and have decent Bluetooth range.Both have an aux input which is nice and you don't get with many Bluetooth speakers in this price range. Both will work while charging which isn't true of some speakers. And both are supposedly rain or shower proof but I haven't tested that.I'd put either Tribit model up against anything from say Logitech even close to the same price. Logitech spends more on marketing than designing better products. I'd also put either Tribit up against most any speaker of the same size at any price.Ultimately either are small enough to throw in your backpack but the smaller cheaper Go is still my favorite portable speaker unless I really need something louder.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2020",AGY7DVH6BSZWM735FPL7UK74Y57A,True,6,Color: Black

Anyhow, after getting over my disappointment I decided to try a different brand and found this Tribit MaxSound. I ordered this and an Oontz Angle Pro, and the clarity overall plus the bass, blew the Oontz Angle Pro away. I was really impressed!If you want ONE speaker that is small, inexpensive, and sounds incredible, this is a great speaker. BUT if you were hoping to get several of them to pair together and spread around your yard or wherever for parties, etc. this will NOT WORK. When you read a dozen product descriptions it gets hard to remember which said which and I swore I could get a few more of these to link together which was my plan and once I heard how great it sounded, I was about to order more of them, but I guess that was a different brand sadly. So I will be returning this and getting 2 Oonzt Angle 3 Ultra which CAN be linked together, even though on it's own this Tribit sounds better.

R1CSCXMH6PSVQ1,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best but better after equalization,Simon Y,4,"Natively, it does not have the bass of Bose soundlink (Mini / Flex) even with XBass enabled. I'm too used to Bose I guess, as I love even a little bit of thump at low volumes. Online reviews gave me the impression the bass is close to Bose, but it isn't so for me. The rear base-reflex of Bose soundlink is louder, giving deeper sounds at very low volumes, especially late at night. (I listened to Soft Rock and 80s new wave) But when used with an equaliser, the Tribit gets close (helped by keeping near the corner of the room). I just need to boost the lower frequencies a little. Higher frequencies no adjustment needed. I bought 2 units to pair in stereo mode to give me a wider soundstage. Even with 2 units (after discounts), it's cheaper than one Bose. Battery-wise, doesn't come close to 20hours. More like 9-10 hours at 50% volume.Edit:1. Managed to get 17hours playback when connected via Aux cable and at low volume.2.

I got this and the X-Sound Go to see which was better, based on all the reviews I saw. It was an extremely close call! You almost don’t notice a difference. This unit won for a slightly louder overall sound, slightly deeper bass and the technicality of larger wattage. I figured I’d want that more in the end. I liked the size of the X-Sound Go much better, but this isn’t bad... just definitely bigger and heavier. The sound is pretty consistent, however I notice that at full volume, the bass fades out and you hear a lot more of the higher tones of the music. The bass sounds more like a low clap in the background. However, turning it down to about 60 percent or lower and you definitely hear a better sounding bass. I do wish that this was updated to Bluetooth 5.0 TWS and also USB-C as they’ve done with the X-Sound Go. I figured I’d be able to deal with the micro USB since I have a couple other devices that also use that still.I also purchased the Asimom 28 Watt speaker. That was also a really close contender, however Tribit won for its overall consistent sound. At lower volume levels, it was louder and clearer.
