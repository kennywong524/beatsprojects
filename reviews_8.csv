R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,True,17,Color: Off White
R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5,"This little speaker surprised me. This “ULT” button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs. Beach proof and clumsy (me) proof.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AHB6M2A23E4MMUH2H364AK7MX5IA,True,12,Color: Off White
RARW9ZM6Q1LZT,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Super impressive sound in a small package!,Franco F,5,"After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments, I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2. I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,True,4,Color: Orange

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker. Hope this review helps!!!","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGCVXRAC7KRNWUCTJSFA2D44CDNA,True,48,Color: Forest Gray
R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,True,13,Color: Off White
R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,True,3,Color: Off White
RD4HR2I5R3X5R,B0CXL5KTBD,3.0 out of 5 stars Not very loud in certain circumstances,Chrissy0418,3,"This is a nice sounding wireless speaker. My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet. If I'm listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice, I can't hear clearly. Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth. The size is perfect as well. It also works great recieving and answering calls.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AEMERIUKJVKXEQ7EFZZKZWYUZJ4Q,True,4,Color: Black
R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,True,0,Color: Forest Gray
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,True,15,Color: Black

Secondly the speaker is THE best looking ""mini"" speaker . So functional the rope strappy thing is amazing. I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip, I think Sony just dropped JBL . The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL.You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking. The way I use it is ULT mode off for podcasts, ULT on for normal music at low volumes and custom on for party mode with MAX bass. if you know how to place this speaker in the room, like higher up you get pure bliss.Love it !","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHI43AKZHAKEPR7CXNMJW3ZJBIZQ,True,1,Color: Off White
R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,True,2,Color: Orange

There are so many Sony speakers and different price points. This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that’s how the quality was in this mini speaker. It’s water proof the strap was better than expected I didn’t care for it but now I can attach to my surroundings environment it’s like an extra nice touch. The app you download is not needed to play or connect it’s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc. the charging is usb C and it fast charging. I just got this speaker and I’m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it’s definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound.

Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone. Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach. I'm definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first.

R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,False,2,Color: Black
R3VJ6HBM3KLRK8,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"First I'd like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal. It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,False,3,Color: Off White
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Orange
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,12,Color: Black

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,False,1,Color: Black

Whatever consumer electronics you buy, whether a TV, stereo or whatever, if it has the Sony label on it, you expect it to be good. That is part of the brand.This speaker delivers the quality you'd expect from Sony. I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok. This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features. But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated, with the Sony brand, you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good.

R3NFO7DBA3ZQJH,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, it sounds great. The bass does get deep.",J. Victor,5,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1. I was very disappointed with the ULT7, if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,False,5,Color: Orange

It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor, so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc. you may want to go with one of the other color options. I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don’t sound good enough to me bc I don’t get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn’t bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it’s nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds! I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness, and I love this speaker so much I don’t really want to get it dirty or wet! But it seems rugged, made out of great materials, and absolutely great to throw in a bag for a trip or mini adventure!

Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker.

It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product.

The Klipsch is something special sound wise but is quite a bit heavier in size, the Soundlink has a better out of the box sound, with EQ the Sony come very close.
