R4BQHA0TLLJNN,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!,Leox,5,"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,True,1,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RH5XTQ13T4DZ9,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats is BACK!,Justin,5,"Look, don't tell Dr. Dre this but I really wanted a new Beats Pill as my dedicated shower speaker. Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet. I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor.Fast forward to 2024, and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model. You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict?

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Which is to say, very good for a small speaker.Compared to the JBL, the Beats Pill is:Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality.Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap (which you can also use to hang the speaker)Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing.My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons. There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface. If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

We used it at birthday parties and the beach and it was perfect for both. Great sound and did not take up any space traveling. So glad i got this! 100% recommend.,"Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AHEIP6M4RBJTXJKY7JUJGPZUPFNA,False,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3L2A88GOC5G6I,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Good speaker,Oli Rivers,5,"The media could not be loaded. For a smallish / portable sized speaker, this sounds great. Works well with my iPhone and sounds high quality and clear with music, which is what it’s for. The bass on this speaker is awesome, so if that’s something you enjoy, you’ll enjoy this. And of course the iconic design still looks fun and unique. It also came with stickers, a cable, and instructions + a bonus. I accidentally got two of the packet things but I’m not complaining at all haha","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFZK22BJRF7EXCXKGIVXNXI2BPPA,False,4,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2AZVHS8KVEN85,B0D4SX9RC6,1.0 out of 5 stars Switches off quickly and unexpectedly even when fully charged.,Dr. Help,1,"Had great hopes for this speaker, but unfortunately, it switches off randomly even when fully charged. Sometimes this happens in less than 30 min which is a big problem because it's battery life is supposed to be much longer than that. It's beautifully made and looks elegant like Beats products do, but unfortunately, it just does not work like it's supposed to.I will update this review if needed based on further experience.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AH2LWMGL3K3SJYIKYDMISWPBAIWQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
