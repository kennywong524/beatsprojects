The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024","profile_id":"AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R1ZHHB1YMHA1IF","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Get a pair!

Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024","profile_id":"AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":3,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion","author":"Daniel","rating":3,"content":"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The \"one touch connect\" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024","profile_id":"AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":12,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R31FPPEOE54HHH","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price","author":"M.J. Shearer","rating":4,"content":"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024","profile_id":"AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R1IDSWYH8GDHSG","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android","author":"Alan","rating":5,"content":"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024","profile_id":"AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA","is_verified":false,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RH5XTQ13T4DZ9","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Beats is BACK!","author":"Justin","rating":5,"content":"Look, don't tell Dr. Dre this but I really wanted a new Beats Pill as my dedicated shower speaker.

In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you.

I've had plenty of bluetooth speakers over the years, and this one is near the top for most important factors such as sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and water resistance. It's a perfect little beach speaker! Connects immediately with mine and my spouse's Android phones; can't say for iPhones.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024","profile_id":"AEP6LM43MWCBTOGT3APWMVNVVHJQ","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RUYA2OVG0565","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly as expected - Great","author":"LS.","rating":5,"content":"I have always been a fan of Beats products and they are well known for being high quality so this newest version of the Beats pill did not disappoint. It sounds great, it can get very loud for just a small little speaker and has very clear sound with exceptional bass woofer. It has a long battery life, charges very quickly and an updated USB-C charging port. It also comes with a code for a free trial of Apple Music and the option to add Apple Care+ and the option to add it to Find My device through Apple.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024","profile_id":"AGXPYVNF5UJTRYMSU66VJDZGYTFQ","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R16YQMK6DBJQBM","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but MONO ruins it!","author":"B Lii","rating":3,"content":"I was stoked to try a speaker from Beats with a great battery life and increased output; however, not having any stereo image from a speaker this wide is just silly, I’m sorry.I’ll stick with the Wonderboom or Everboom.

Easily connected to my (Android) Pixel 7 Pro via Bluetooth. Good battery life. Lightweight - very easy to carry to different rooms or garage, wherever you are working/hanging out. I like the stylish but minimalist look. Got the tan so it wouldn't show dust like black would (the red looks great but I wanted a speaker to sit on a bookshelf and not stand out too much.) It is great that it works with both Android and iOs - I have music and audio books on both my iPad and Pixel 7 Pro phone, so this is very convenient. Highly recommended.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024","profile_id":"AHLK2LAWI4UYYTYTF5PQQE3RTDYQ","is_verified":false,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R38GQ5W13HCMHD","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars good sound quality","author":"Jenglish","rating":5,"content":"Use this for multiple purposes.

Can easily get battery information directly from device. AirPlay integration would have been welcome.Controls are simple, although take some practice to get used to. Power button controls both power and pairing. I do wish the Pill could be turned on with one touch of power button. I've yet to test the microphone/speaker function, but that's a nice enough addition.I find the sound great, but I am no audiophile. I intend to use this speaker for what portable speakers are best designed for- travel, beach, patio, etc. It sounds excellent, even at moderate volume. The dual pairing function looks awesome, although not within my use case.Design is sleek and feels solid- but light enough for great portability. The soft touch silicone feels great, although I can foresee being a bit of a dirt magnet, at least on the champagne gold model. The lanyard is a welcome addition, but I do wish it was adjustable- unsure what the point of adding a lanyard is if it cannot be tightened/loosened. USB-C is a great addition, as is fast fuel.Battery life is rated at 24H. Based on early usage, I would believe this to be reasonably accurate. Unit drained about 10% listening to podcasts at ~50% volume.Overall positive first impression. Definitely not a cheap speaker, but you are buying this for the ecosystem integration, good sound, and excellent battery life. Price is pretty on par with similar quality speakers. Beats products are frequently discounted, so maybe wait for a sale.","timestamp":"Reviewed in Canada July 2, 2024","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"R2ZF60HWQ8L0NI","title":"Amazing speaker","author":"Ted Has","rating":5,"content":"Feels so solid of a device, highly recommend it.

With a punchy bass and a wide sound stage even for classical/film music, I've enjoyed using them (yes, I got a pair) for music and watching Netflix. The sound quality from stereo pair is absolutely amazing.🔋 I love that it is type C fast-charge, and that battery lasts for at least 2-days of normal use; the feature to reverse charge ur other devices is certainly nice but a bit gimmicky in my opinion considering I've never found a scenario to do so.📲 It supports airplay and findmy, and I could control it from my Mac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, and my Apple Watch. A nice convenience feature.The Bad:❌ A price tag of $199 CAD (2x HomePod mini) is just not affordable to most, especially for a pair ($398)❌ The shape of the pill + the rather hefty weight makes it harder to grab❌ Sometimes I'd get the spinny wheel on Airplay for the longest time without connecting to the Pill❌ I could not connect to the app for stereo pair at all. The app never \"found\" my Pills.❌ You must hold down your fingers on two Pills concurrently to enter stereo mode, not v user friendly.❌ With power button serving many functions, I had to learn how many seconds it takes to turn on/off, enter pairing mode, etc.❌ The soft rubber surface on top and around the Pill's back attract all kinds of micro dusts and lint.Verdict: While the New Beats Pill delivers incredible sound quality, compatibility, and performance, it is NOT designed with user-friendly interactions in mind. The many little inconveniences will eventually add up to the point you realize it is probably not worth it for its hefty price tag.Alternative: The Bose SoundFlex offers virtually the same features (except for Airplay compatibility), it is more affordable, has a functional in-app pairing/control experience, has an extra speaker grill in its back, and pairs to 2 devices simultaneously while supporting automatic pause/play as you switch between devices.","timestamp":"Reviewed in Canada July 31, 2024","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+"},{"id":"RDNZF4I13GKT4","title":"Satisfaction Pill","author":"YAN","rating":5,"content":"It’s compact and efficient, with the lithium battery and usb-C charger integrated, it doesn’t take much time to be fully charged.
