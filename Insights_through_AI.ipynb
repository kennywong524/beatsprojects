            "\n",
            "1. **Efficient Sort:** This function determines the most efficient sorting algorithm based on the size of the input array. It uses insertion sort for arrays of 10 elements or fewer and quicksort for larger arrays. This is because insertion sort is generally faster for small arrays, while quicksort has a better average time complexity for larger arrays.\n",
            "2. **Insertion Sort:** This function implements insertion sort, which is an in-place sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.\n",
            "3. **Quicksort:** This function implements quicksort, which is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the array around a pivot element and recursively sorting the subarrays. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Array Size:** The optimal choice of sorting algorithm depends heavily on the size of the array. For very small arrays, insertion sort or bubble sort can be quite fast. For larger arrays, quicksort, merge sort, or heapsort are typically more efficient.\n",
            "* **Data Distribution:** If the data is already partially sorted, some algorithms like insertion sort may be more efficient than others.\n",
            "* **Stability:** Some algorithms (e.g., insertion sort) are stable, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order after sorting. Others (e.g., quicksort) are not stable.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Remember:** The \"most efficient\" sorting algorithm can vary depending on the specific context and constraints of your problem. \n",

Hopefully they will get that fixed soon.\",\n          \"This thing is great. I don't like poor sounding tunes, they won't be tolerated in my presence. This speaker delivers.Sound - this speaker has full and dynamic range. Reaches good highs and deep enough lows. I was initially confused by the bass button - of course I want the bass! - but while using it and responsibly talking with some friends from a distance, I found it was helpful to turn just the bass down. I don't usually do this, but it's actually a nice feature.Volume - My last blutooth speaker blew the woofer on 4th of July while getting our freedom on. This speaker is easily 4x as loud (and 3x the price). At near max volume, it sounds great too. It's easily loud enough to fill a backyard and be heard with kids screaming. It's easily too loud for anywhere indoors unless you're getting wild. At low volume, the bass can be a little more loud than it needs to be (muddy) so you might push the button to turn the bass down.Range - Seems to be pretty good. I've only had my phone about 20ft from it and it didn't skip a beat.Battery - It'll blast the beats for at least 8 hours (that's about the longest I've had it running). I've used it about 15 times for 30 minutes each on a single charge (at low volume). I haven't yet pushed it hard enough to kill the battery. So i'd say it's pretty good.Size - About the size of a 16oz can of delicious brewskie. Twice the weight. I still use a much smaller (wallet sized) speaker for more personal use such as when hiking/mtn biking. This big boi goes to the pool with us, on the back patio, and in the garage all the time.Bonus - I chose this based on some online reviews AND that it's directional - meaning the speakers all face one direction. This means I can focus music to where i want it playing. For me, this was important. If you want omnidirectional music, this doesn't exactly do that.- Cheers\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 227,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024\",\n          \"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"profile_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 587,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"AGQZNURWLGF7SHEOEUUPQ2LAHCLQ\",\n          \"AGI32NTGVPE6LLVZHIJVTAMUFOZQ\",\n          \"AH5TS7YMZWV4FC5TPO7M4FSZ5GGQ\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 17,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          17\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_attributes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Color: WhiteStyle: Flip 6\",\n          \"Color: Green\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
