R4BQHA0TLLJNN,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!,Leox,5,"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,1,1,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,1,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,1,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,0,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RH5XTQ13T4DZ9,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats is BACK!,Justin,5,"Look, don't tell Dr. Dre this but I really wanted a new Beats Pill as my dedicated shower speaker. Just something I can set on the shelf by the shower and jam out to without worrying about it getting wet. I misplaced my old one years ago and I always liked the pill shaped form factor.Fast forward to 2024, and we have a brand new Beats Pill that is redesigned from the old model. You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict?

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Needs more buttons,Carpe_Diem,3,"This Bluetooth speaker is on the higher end of the price range for a small form factor speaker.Priced similarly to the JBL Extreme 2 (which I also have) the sound quality is about the same. Which is to say, very good for a small speaker.Compared to the JBL, the Beats Pill is:Not as loudHas a slightly better sound quality.Slightly smallerDoes not have a carrying strap (which you can also use to hang the speaker)Pairs automatically with Apple devices and can be tracked using Find MyBoth offer multiple speaker pairing.My biggest complaint about the Pill is that there are just not enough buttons. There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface. If you don't mind learning a few tricks to use this device it will be great.However, if you are one of those people who doesn't read instructions, get something that is more intuitive to use.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AEI3MIZ54YO5TX6CXG6OE5HGGGXA,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

It does a have a few imperfections, but overall I think it deserves 5 stars. The mids and highs get drowned out a bit by the bass when indoors. However, I’ve found that when outside, the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on. It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy. Highly recommend for audiophiles looking for an outdoor speaker that you want to bring with you anywhere.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AF3PVTN5RKAL3R2VZTNN6W5N3BIQ,1,0,Color: GreyStyle: Flip 6
R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I’ve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I’ve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn’t believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I’ve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you’re entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you’re able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can’t help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,1,11,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you’ll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEKPQRCBV3DNLRZCMJSGQMSGSLAA,1,1,Color: Black

RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6TTR3C,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you’ve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it’s okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don’t try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you’re pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I’m missing the mark on its intended use, but I don’t think so. For small sound and high portability, it’s okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I’ll have to sample it for a while and along others. I’m on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I’ll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it’s pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it’s been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,1,7,Color: White

I would compare it only to the Klipsch, B & O, Devialet.So why did I rate it 4 stars?1. I find it insulting or worse when a piece of equipment in this price range is so intrusive, puts so much effort into violating your privacy. Install the app and you will have none. I fully intend to uninstall rhe app. I may even do a full reset on my phone, but having installed it and created an accoujnt I asm already on a list they wil undoubtedly be selling.You can set up blue tooth without the app, but not wifi. Having connected to blue tooth I had to reset the speaker to install the app. It took me hou4rs, much like the B & O, which I was unhappy with for exactly the same reasons.*IF* you use th3 app you can not use a music player.

(Wifi and blue tooth will do that) make a call and could not because I was using the speaker. It also completely drained my phone's battery.2. Using a player would not have given me the benefits I get on many other blue tooth speakers because the Roam does not process lossless blue tooth codecs. You lose detail in transmission. Not everyone cares about this but most audiophile listeners do, so for a company of this quality, producing equipment in this price range, it is surprising and disappointing.No aptx, aptx hd or ldac.It does do some tricks if you have other Sonos speakers, like casting to the speaker in the next room.3.

The app does get you spatial tuning, BUT, besides issues already mentioned I lost the DAC on my FIIO, in addition to lossless blue tooth.In sum, the sound is very good but I feel that you pay a high price for it in terms of intrusiveness.I do not feel as though I would be sacrificing a great deal if I listened to my Klipsch instead, on my FIIO, weith location... turned off on my phone. We all have our priorities. Mine is most definitely sound quality, and this speaker do3es sound very good but I hzavwe to question some of their choices, to include not using lossless blue tooth codecs.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,0,0,Color: White
RU984OCJ1IVM6,B0CY6TTR3C,"3.0 out of 5 stars The hardware is great, but the SONOS app is horrible.",diamond dave,3,"SONOS Roam is a great little Bluetooth speaker. The size is easy to carry around, and it has really good sound for such a small form factor. The Alexa integration is also very good - you can power up the speaker and ask Alexa to play anything through connected services like Spotify or other music libraries and it does what you expect it to do - play music! The real let down is in in the recent overhaul of the Sonos app. Unfortunately, Sonos took a very good functioning S2 app and ruined it when they relaunched the app to handle the new Sonos Ace headphones. They've been working on re-adding features for the last two months and it's starting to improve, but very slowly. So buyer beware - you may want to wait until they get the app back to a more solid state before you jump into a Roam. However, the Roam does work well with Bluetooth and Airplay, so for now that's a great way to still play music.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AH2NLQV3HKYPSPZJAU2FGCUV37GA,0,0,Color: Black

The speaker is very good with rich bass and very clean sound production. The volume is good but it's a 7 inch device so it's not going to blow you out of the room. The first thing people say is that it is amazing for it's size. I agree and appreciate it for the amazing sound and portability. This is easy competition for Beats pill or the Bose versions in this size group and better in many ways. One of the ways is the tech. Also known as the bad reviews, at least for now. They need to update some areas with the software and the app. This needs to work perfect for what it cost (I hope you hear me Sonos!). If they fix the connectivity and wifi issues this is a winner. If you want a great piece of hardware with stand alone function it's a winner. For owners of other Sonos products having issues, they owe you an apology and a quick solution. I use it alone and have not added it to my system for this reason. I hope you can make a decision to buy or wait based on this info.

I was impressed with the low end of this speaker for its compact small size, but other than that, I can’t say that I would recommend on sound quality. The high end is completely missing and adjusting via the setting does virtually nothing. I want to qualify that with the fact I understand I’m not getting a live performance out of this thing but there really is no high end. I did t have any issues connecting to the product via Bluetooth as other have stated but if that is the case a software update should fix those. I had and issue at first hooking Apple Music into it but a reboot of my phone and the speaker fixed that. Its small size makes it versatile and it surely feels like a quality product. Battery life is good while overall performance is meh middle of the road.

I've used Sonos speakers in the past and was pretty impressed with those. This speaker in particular though, I have to honestly say is not quite as good as some other Sonos I have used in the past. Pairing over Bluetooth is simple, as with like any other Bluetooth speaker or other device. Pairing is the same. But like the other Sonos speakers this is also made specifically to work with the Sonos App in which you can connect multiple speakers throughout a home. That works well but I struggle to see why that'd be important on a portable speaker. I suppose it is nice to have the option. The sound is very good. It can get loud enough for a whole room. The trembles and mids are nice and clear. The bass is loud too (but I did notice some mudding at higher volume which is honestly to be expected with a portable speaker like this.) I took off the one star for this.Overall I think this is a very good speaker and people who want the Sonos app connectivity will love this. But I took off the one star because the sound is about the same as some other premium Bluetooth speakers that cost significantly less. That being said, this is still a good pick for people who want that app connectivity or just like the Sonos brand. I am satisfied with it.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AFS2T4U7QKGVSZ6AFT3ZNA7DY2IA,0,0,Color: Black

Setup was pretty straightforward, but I did need to reboot it a couple times to get it to properly play in sync with the other speakers. I think that may have just been a one-time thing, since it's worked perfectly every other time I've sent music to it.In terms of sound, it's pretty good. It doesn't have a super rich bass, compared to my other Sonos speakers, but it's still decent. I use the overture from Tron: Legacy as a test track, so I have a reference I can compare on each speaker I listen on, and it does miss some of the really rich deep notes when the music swells at around 1:35.All that said, this isn't a one-speaker-replacement for an amazing sound system. It's a portable speaker that sounds pretty great, which is suitable for taking outdoors and can sync with your existing Sonos system, and it excels at that. I mostly use it as a small portable speaker playing jazz on my back patio during family get-togethers or dinner, and to supplement my existing Sonos system, and it is perfect for that.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AH2DY3SGYMCGUSFYXZLQO2S7XLBQ,0,2,Color: Black

In this case, I used Home Assistant to connect to the Sonos Roam 2 and send audio. In my case, I have the speaker plugged into trickle charge as I mostly have power where it’s at, but the battery as a little battery back up so I can continue to control it even when there is no power at that location. Battery life is about as you would expect for something of that size. Nothing too stellar but nothing that’s gonna drop off ridiculously quick either.Sound quality wise, this lives up to the Sonos name. Sound was rich and full with no issues at any of the extremes. Adjustability and control are exactly as Sonos advertises and they work great. While there is a microphone included, I did not test that feature, though I would imagine, it should work.It also has Bluetooth and that seems to work well. It pairs nicely and you can send audio to it just fine. Range is about as expected with no problems that I experienced.About the only thing that should be noted is it really wants a high-speed USB-C charger. And my case I trickle charge it over an old-school USB charger and it warns me, but it sits plugged in most of the time so it’s OK. If you want to charge it faster though you’re going to need to use a proper USB-C charger.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHNR76YHIEJ2R73EOK6VHX22YYVA,0,0,Color: Black

This speaker sounds good, not quite as nice as the Sonos 1 but when they are paired together I can't really tell the difference.

Initial set up with Bluetooth was simple, but getting it to pair with my Sonos 1 took a couple minutes, a WTF, and a phone restart to get everything synced up. I wish charging status light would stay on while charging, mine doesn't even with the status light enabled in app. Also wish battery % wasn't buried so far down the app, it should be right there on the main screen in the app. Is this the best speaker at this size and price, I don't know but probably not..

However, since launch we have found a number of issues. Fixing these issues has delayed our prior plan to quickly incorporate missing features and functionality.Since May 7, we have released new software updates approximately every two weeks, each making significant and meaningful improvements, adding features and fixing bugs. Please see the release notes for Sonos software updates for detailed information on what has been released to date.While these software updates have enabled the majority of our customers to have a robust experience using the Sonos app, there is more work to be done.

This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,1,17,Color: Black

Setup was a breeze, and the Bluetooth connectivity works flawlessly with my devices. I even got a cute matching accessory holder to carry it like a handbag.

R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,1,17,Color: Black

It has a “party” setting also. I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely! I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot! It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker. Just follow the instructions provided! This was a great investment because I’m all about music 🎶 and good sound. I even listen to my podcasts using them. You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone, which is really convenient! Even if I’m talking on the phone and want the conversation heard, it can come across the speaker! The USB/C charger cord comes with it. It charges very quickly! I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to. These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had! But then….it’s a BOSE!!!! The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too. That’s especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants! I don’t have to worry about its stability, although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing! If you like what I described, you will want to own one or more!

R3N5UYTNS8D2V6,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Small speaker, big sound, travel friendly",jonathan lopez,4,"Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It’s loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn’t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you’ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I’m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn’t really have any equalizer setting on there if that’s what you’re loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it’s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I’m going to keep this speaker with me. Now let’s see if the battery life is legit. I’ll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,1,6,Color: Green
R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,1,17,Color: Chilled Lilac
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,1,1,Color: Black

I tried to chat with the Bose help bot, but it was of no help; the lady on the phone at Bose tech support was of no help and disconnected mid-sentence and didn't call me back. I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'.

While you technically can pair multiple devices, you cannot switch between them if more than one device is present. For instance, my wife and I have both paired our phones. We paired hers first, then mine. If she is within range, it will always pair with hers. No problem, right? Wrong. If we want to switch to my phone, she has to turn her Bluetooth off on her phone. There's no way to override it and pair to mine instead. Even putting it back in pairing mode won't let us switch.The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the battery lasts forever. We use it almost nightly for about an hour, and have only had to charge it once in the 3 months we've owned it.Bottom line, if battery life is your highest priority, then this might be a good buy. If you want something that sounds good, and is easy to use, look elsewhere.Edit* bumping up to 4 stars. The company reached out to help remedy the issues.

This Christmas, I gifted my husband a wireless Bluetooth speaker, and it has been nothing short of spectacular, earning a well-deserved 5-star review. Since he unwrapped it, the speaker has become a daily feature in our home, providing a constant backdrop of his favorite tunes.The speaker’s sound quality is outstanding. The built-in subwoofers deliver deep, rich bass that can be felt as much as heard, creating an immersive listening experience. Whether it’s for background music during dinner or the centerpiece at a small gathering, the speaker fills our space with clear, vibrant sound.One of the best features is its sheer loudness without any distortion. It’s impressive how it maintains clarity and quality even at high volumes, making it perfect for both indoor and outdoor use.Connecting devices to the speaker has been a breeze. The Bluetooth pairing process is straightforward and hassle-free, allowing my husband to easily link his phone or laptop within seconds. This ease of use adds to the overall enjoyment and functionality of the speaker.The design deserves a mention too; it’s sleek, modern, and fits beautifully into our living space. It’s portable as well, so we can move it around the house or take it outside.In summary, this wireless Bluetooth speaker with subwoofers has been a fantastic purchase. It offers excellent sound quality, ease of use, and versatility, making it an ideal gift for anyone who loves music.

I put a fair amount of research into this speaker and it's really not as good as I was hoping, but it's not necessarily bad - it all depends on what music you plan to listen to. Rock music or anything with a bit of heaviness to it seems to end up sounding a bit flat and muddled when all instruments are kicking in. But it works very well for pop music and anything with a bit more breathing space. It has decent bass and volume, although the highs sound a bit tinny and in some cases appeared to distort when listening to rockier music.I also made the mistake of listening to the speaker at half volume. The speaker sounds best at higher volumes, when it's used for background music it sounds much flatter, it seems to need the volume to make the different frequencies stand out more clearly from one another.Overall if you can get it for a good price then it's not the worst option but there are better options out there, although they may cost you another $30 more than this one.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",Unknown,1,1,Color: Black

Reviews of other Bluetooth speakers rave about ""booming base"" or exclaim over how loud the speakers get. If those kind of endorsements appeal to you, maybe you should look elsewhere. For me, a speaker review that touts ""booming base"" is almost a non-starter. I'd rather have no base at all than base that is boomy. The combination of the Minirig 3 and the Minirig subwoofer play plenty loud, but most importantly they produce very high-end reproduction. Highly recommended.

R24VZIARGPXY09,B00FK56KL8,Great product in all important aspects. But...,javiej,5,"Sound: Best in the portable arena. Great for travel and also for the car (most cars have decent mids and treble but they lack base). This unit will solve it without being tied ""only"" to the car.Still not the best option for home, there is a said in the audio arena "" a sub under 10 inch is not a sub"", and this device is no exception (this is not about volume at all, but it can't be explained with words, you have to experience a 10inch sub even at low levels to understand what I mean ). But still pretty decent for home use (if you can't have a real sub). This device will make the difference between just listening music or really enjoying the sound.Look & feel: Brilliant. It feels premium in all aspects, and the sleeve is absolutely awesome. I didn't expect such a great design so it was a nice surprise.Audio compatibility: Amazing!. I was in doubt because I thought this device was overpriced, but this particular point was the very reason that made me click the ""buy it now"". This brand having their own speakers and not forcing you to use their own with the sub ? and in fact they make it trivial? no app or workarounds neccesary? Resisting the new Apple law to prosecute audio jacks at the cost of adding bluetooth latency, compression and connectivity issues ? ... that's very unique in the portable premium arena and it is the main reason I gave 5 stars. Even if it is not perfect in some other aspects this point is really a 6 star. A portable sub with standard in & out 3.5mm standard audio jacks and no obligatory bs., this is probably the only one. That is really what made me think: Uhm, there is a true audio guy in this company, they are not just tech hipsters, so I'm in.But .. yes there is a but,... the power connector...... why?In a 5V device in 2021 and at this price level it is almost unacceptable to not include a proper usb power connector (ideally usb-c, or at least a miserable micro usb). Instead they give you a 5V barrel without power supply and a ridiculous workaround in the cable for a weird usb with ""PD"" passtrough but no data ... They have invented a solution for a problem that didn't exist!, while creating other problems on the way.Come on at this price level if you say your device can act like a power bank you have to do it properly with a couple of usb connectors as everybody does, and those connectors only cost 1 pound. First thing because using standards cables is good for the planet, and second because accepting standard usb connections rather than a short Frankenstein cable would give us a lot of flexibility for charging and for the placement of the device , which in a sub it is an important thing, specially while travelling which is when you need to improvise those aspects all the time. Not to mention the inconveniences if we lose or break this absurd cable, which for most users it is just a question of time.But no worries nobody is perfect, and fortunately the in&out 3.5mm jacks compensates this point. So that's is a 5 star.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom August 16, 2021",Unknown,1,4,Color: Black

R18FJK33IP7ADX,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars You can’t go wrong with this.,Amazon Customer,5,"This tiny speaker has been such a joy to listen to music with. For context, I am by no means an audiophile, but love listening to music loudly and with a lot of bass. I listen on Spotify, YouTube, and occasionally Apple Music. Here is a detailed review from an avid music listener:Sound quality:This speaker is so crisp and clear it is unbelievable. Even at max volume it doesn’t clip or distort unless the mix on the song is off. The bass is incredible, pretty much the main reason I bought it, for that BOOM. Since the speaker uses 2 passive radiators, to really feel the bass you need to place the speaker by a wall or in the corner of two walls so the sound can bounce off them. It is actually insane how powerful the bass gets when you do that. You can feel parts of your body as well as the floor vibrating. One thing to note, there is a “bass “ button on the speaker and it definitely improves the bass, but look on to the next paragraph to make the bass even better.Out of the box, the speaker doesn’t sound as good as it could. This is because the equalizer has not been adjusted, so the sound signature is pretty flat. If you’re into that then great, but if not you can download the soundcore app and tweak the sound to your liking. In the picture I posted you can find my EQ, and boy does it make the sound louder, the bass bigger, and the songs overall more vibrant and bouncy. I listen to a lot of hip hop, so the bass and low end sounds great with that genre. But I also listen to a lot of indie and folklore, and the highs sound equally nice. Also, for EDM, this speaker is spectacular. The synths are bright and poppy, the drums are commanding and hard hitting, and the singer’s voice sounds great, not muffled or overpowered by the other aspects of the song. (And if they are, you can change the EQ) You can also power off your speaker from your phone app, which is pretty cool.Portability:The speaker is relatively easy to carry around. It has a rubberized handle and is only a couple pounds. I like to put it in my backpack when walking around or hanging out outside. It is waterproof too I believe, so you could get it wet, but I wouldn’t recommend submerging it in the pool because you never really know how waterproof it is until that happens. It is pretty tough too, but it has a hard plastic exterior so it might crack if dropped multiple times. But from my experience with it it’s super tough but easy to carry.Other aspects:The price is completely justifiable, sitting at around $100. It is by far the loudest and clearest speaker you will find in that price range, and can probably compete with $200-300 speakers as well. Battery life is amazing. I can go a whole week, hours a day, at half-volume, listening to music without charging it. And because it’s USB C I can use my Mac or iPad charger to charge it. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty much flawless; I usually connect it to my iPhone, iPad or Mac, and rarely experience a pause or interruption unless I walk very far from the speaker. (Probably 50 feet no walls, or 30 feet with some walls if I had to guess). The only issue I see with this speaker is that it lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. This could be problematic if your device doesn’t have Bluetooth, but thankfully everything I need to connect the speaker to has Bluetooth. ALSO, forgot to mention that I also watch a lot of YouTube vids with the speaker and there is almost no latency. This means the voices sync up great with characters in the shows you watch, and everything works perfectly for other means of media besides music.Final thoughts:As I said before, I love listening to music out loud, and with a lot of bass. Not just punchy artificial bass, but bass you can feel; deep booming bass. This speaker has that. I literally bought this speaker to replace a full sound system with dual tweeters and dedicated sub because this speaker is more convenient and sounds pretty comparable to the sound system with the right EQ. Obviously it won’t be able to replace the bass from a good subwoofer, but it is more than enough for me and the clarity is actually better than the sound system I replaced. (It is an old altec Lansing system for reference). If you are looking for a more enjoyable listening experience, for basically any genre of music, OR if you are looking to enhance your TV’s sound system (assuming it has Bluetooth), then this is absolutely the speaker for you. The soundcore motion boom makes listening to music more enjoyable and ultimately I’m so glad I bought it. Do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one, I really have no complaints about it besides no 3.5mm aux, but it is truly a gem.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2021",AGWMGBFA36PTVZKPEQBWBVV5VWJA,1,17,Color: Black
R1B7TOI9GECWNW,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars These things are pretty amazing,StanDaMan1985,5,"So, I purchased the first speaker on Black Friday, and the second one a week after. I’m now just getting around to writing a review.When I received the first speaker, I thought that it sounded amazing. The sound is crisp. It’s clear. The bass sounds awesome. I am using these as indoor speakers for now.After receiving the first speaker, and then receiving the second one, I realize that the first speaker is making an odd hissing sound compared to the second one. I reached out to the seller, and I was able to receive a replacement within a few days.They are both connected to each other. And they sound amazing.The Bluetooth connectivity is quick. The sound coming out of both of these speakers is pretty incredible especially if you think about the amount of money that is spent on both.Out the door, because I purchased both speakers when they were on clearance, I’ve paid around $150.Is that a lot? Comparatively. However, if you look at their direct competitors, such as JBL or Sony or Bose, two of these cost as much as one of those.I understand that these are waterproof. I have not tested that out yet, but if I do, I will definitely update my review.Also, and keep in mind that these are exactly what they say these are. These are speakers that sound amazing that have an awesome base, and awesome trouble, and all in all sound like they are double or triple the cost of what I paid.Not Shamie, but just some the fact that these don’t have any sort of a smart assistant built in, may be an issue. However, they are connected to your device. So, your devices assistant, still technically works.The battery life on these things is pretty incredible as well.Keep in mind, I don’t have these on 24 seven. I can’t tell you this, since I’ve had these, and since I’ve been using these, I’ve only had to charge these things two times.Even at loud volumes, there is no sound distortion. There is no distortion of base, or the voice, or the trouble.To sum up, if you are in the market for a Bluetooth speaker that can function and work outside. A speaker that also has the ability of being around water, and a speaker that can float, definitely pick one or two or three of these up.If you’re looking for indoor speakers that sound amazing when they are paired together, definitely pick up a couple of these. If you think about it, two of these cost as much as one of the competitors. Trust me, I don’t think anyone would be disappointed if they were to grab one of these, even if it’s at full price.I’ve been ranting and raving about the speakers ever since I’ve got them to all of my family and friends. Two of my buddies have already picked up several of these for their boats and RVs.Oh… Almost forgot. There is an app that goes along with the speakers. Definitely download the app. You can change sound profiles, and you also can set your own custom EQ settings.The speakers will also install their own updates when you turn them on and you open the app. It will update drivers and update its own firmware. That’s pretty awesome.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2022",AGSEQMSONU5HO2LUCAMQ67KFKS3A,1,17,Color: Black

R123EOTRRUAETZ,B08LQNL42Z,"4.0 out of 5 stars A whole lot to like, but not five stars",Allen,4,"After reading most of the other reviews here, I was prepared to be totally wowed and bowled over.I wasn't.There is a whole lot to like about this speaker:* The 10 Ah battery lasts about a day and a half short of forever. The only BT speaker I own which beats it is the original Anker Soundcore. Real world conditions, 60 hours.* You can reverse its power to charge another device; In other words, it's also a power bank. And like I said, its battery life is so long that you could charge a 5000 mah phone from E to F from this device after it itself is full, and you'll still have half a tank left in the speaker, which will still last a long time.* Second best sound quality and rocking out ability of all my BT speakers, second only to the DOSS SoundBox XL - But that device has an actual powered subwoofer, and has a battery life as short as the Soundcore Motion Boom is long.* The Soundcore Motion Boom (SCMB) is I think the inverted version of its cousin, the Soundcore 3, which I also own. The SC3 is a small daily driver speaker that has the ability to rock out pretty hard for its size in a pinch. The SCMB is a rocking out speaker that has the ability to be a perfectly rational daily driver at lower volumes, though its size means that actually doing so is impractical, even though the unibody handle makes that not as hard as it otherwise would be.* The Anker app and its sound options, pretty good. Recommended.* The fact that it does not make any kind of noise, boops or beeps for its low battery warning (WHICH IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION, OTHER MANUFACTURERS). The red power light will flash on and off, but that's it. And that starts at around 10% battery in my observation. I would have set that at 1%, but that's just a nit pick. And it's a good thing that it makes no low battery noises, because, like I said, the battery lasts so long that even starting low battery warning noises at 1% still means you'd have a half hour or so of low battery beeping interrupting whatever you're listening to.A strange quirk that should be fixed for future generations of this product: The power button, the TWS button, the BT pairing button and the Bass-Up button are lighted. But the up/down volume rockers and the center soft function key are not lighted. I don't catch the drift of that omission.I'll also note that it accepts only 2.1 A of charging current max, so even if you charge this on a 2.4 A or higher charger, it will only take in 2.1 A, which means six hours to charge from E to F. Longer if your charging outlet is below 2.1 A. Which means charging is an overnight thing. Perhaps the next generation will upgrade to 2.4 A or maybe 3 A. With a 10 Ah battery, the charging rate should be higher. In addition, one good thing about charging is that, when it is charging, the power button stays steady red, and switches to steady white when it's done. My peeve with other BT speakers in my collection is that it uses red for charging and green for charged, or vice versa, when I'm red-green colorblind.""Okay, so why not five stars?""Because most of you in this review section were so extra and over the top with your cheerleading, that the sound quality, while overall pretty good not great, in terms of quality, accuracy, bass, mids, trebles, the whole nine, it's just not commensurate with the garish reviews. I'll put it another way: The only reason I am disappointed in this device is precisely because all the hype gave me over-inflated expectations.It's as if the people writing these reviews have never heard any audible sounds in their lives before. Though we know it's not that. Probably more so the truth is that they're paid shills.I'll also add that you really need to pick the right EQ options with your source material and/or the Soundcore app if you want this thing to show is good (not great) treble ability.No 3.5 mm wired headphone jack, if that matters.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2021",AHAXGVYQVJUIU2SKOOR4MIM4SZVQ,1,17,Color: Black

R1GK07JYPVAM6H,B08LQNL42Z,"5.0 out of 5 stars It's great, so let's just talk about th cons...",The Great Cornholio,5,"Five stars, just to get that out of the way. Stunning battery life, able to charge a phone in a pinch, sound quality is really good.First off, some audiophile freaks are saying that it's not ""that"" good. Look genius, these have 2.75"" speakers. If you expected more than what you're getting, you need to read less snake oil and learn more physics. I rate sound quality 1-4. Passable alone, passable in a loud place, enjoyable at home a room away, and makes-your-hairs-stand-up. This is a 3/4 on this scale which is surprising given the size of these speakers. This is what the ""nicer"" PC speakers were 20 years ago. They've come a long way...Next, I hear from other people that this should float rightside-up while in a pool or river. I agree. And I don't doubt the truth of what they say, it just never occurred to me to expect electronics to function in water unless explicitly advertised as such. This isn't advertised as a floating device, it just has a nice waterproof rating. Those are different things.Next, people say you need to download the app to get decent sound out of it. If you don't like the sound, this is true. But if your mother is over 70 years old and her hearing is going and she just wants to be able to hear music better, then the app isn't needed. I have it. I use it. I appreciate it. I even move the speaker around my rooms to make it sound better. But even I don't really need to app that much. It saves the settings, so you really only need to use the app once, if that.Next, the volume buttons really should be illuminated. I agree with the people saying that. And a pause/play button would be nice. Other than that, it's a phenomenal value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AG4SJ5JBYXGL42GRWTRAHQMV54MQ,1,16,Color: Black
R30109GO569YCW,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Boomin',Marc V.,5,"I'll be honest, right out the box, I was not impressed. The default Soundcore sound is very flat. Thankfully, you are able to adjust the sound with the Soundcore app's equalizer. Once I adjusted the sound to my liking, I was pleasantly surprised. Audiophiles will not be blown away by the sound, but at this price point, I can't see how some people expect $300+ sound from an under $100 speaker. Also, this thing is loud! The bass doesn't blow you over, but you feel it.So far, I've used this during tailgates and at the beach and it sounds great outdoors. It's lightweight and compact, but it doesn't look or feel cheap. I think my only ""con"" is that you can't pair with other bluetooth speakers unless it's another Soundcore Boom. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2024",AFVFXAKH2LI2RRYEJXDGHCHLRBEQ,1,0,Color: Black
R2DPREBVBQ8MQ7,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome,Patrick Sheeley,5,"I don't usually write reviews but in this case I feel that I have to. I originally ordered the Sony Ult field 1 wireless ultra and after living with it for over a week and listening to different genres of music I decided that I had to return it. Not that it's a bad Bluetooth speaker but when I played bass heavy content it seemed like I constantly adjusting the bass because of the distortion I was getting;that being said content that wasn't bass heavy was ok. Another issue that I had was the volume,I thought that it would play louder than it did but it did not. Volume was ""ok"" but for my tastes I wish it had a bit more oomph to it. I've owned many Sony products in my life but this just didn't do it for me, even the equalizer on the app was about as basic as they come. Now the Souncore motion boom...this thing just sounds more meatier than the Sony did. Volume goes louder, equalizer on the app is much better than the Sony, and like I said to my ears it just sounds more thick, music has more substance to it. This looks like it's going to be a keeper, highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AFUNJ7HWDPAKNIYGZKQEO3VZ6PDA,1,0,Color: Black
R2U6B0N78540QJ,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth speaker I've ever heard … when using the custom 9-band EQ App,Jim,5,"The Soundcore Motion Boom is the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I've ever heard … but only after installing the phone App and creating a custom ""mid-scoop"" EQ with it.Words fail to describe how wonderful and ""musical"" it sounds with the custom EQ. Rich, warm, full, detailed sound and effortless, deep bass.For a comparison, here are some advantages compared to the similar size JBL Xtreme 3 … which also has end-mounted, passive radiators to enhance deep bass:-- Motion Boom is $110; JBL is $380-- Motion Boom battery life is 24 hours; JBL is 15-- Motion Boom deep bass has no compression artifacts; JBL compresses at high volume-- Motion Boom sounds so much better with the 9-band custom EQ (not offered by JBL)*** Human Hearing & Loudness Contour ***Streaming music has a wide frequency range from ~50 Hz low bass to ~12kHz high treble. But human ears are most sensitive to 1kHz~5kHz … which can make music sound brash in the midrange. For more on this, do a web-search for: Fletcher Munson curve / equal loudness contour / ISO 226:2003.*** Custom EQ is The Key Feature ***The way our ears hear music is why home stereos have a ""Loudness Compensation"" button to cut mid-range. Pro musicians & sound men do the same thing with graphic equalizers and the resulting curve resembles a ""U"" or a ""smiley-face"".Being able to do this with the Soundcore phone app's 9-band EQ is a ""game changer"". It transforms the sound … but only IF you know how to set it (""mid-scoop"" is not one of the standard Presets … it needs to be created as a custom setting)As a suggestion to Soundcore, they will get even more enthusiastic, happy customers and great reviews if ""Mid-Scoop"" is added as one of the four standard Presets in a future firmware update.*** How to Install & Activate the phone App ***1. Visit apps.apple.com or play.google.com, search for the free Soundcore app and install2. On the phone, go to Settings > Soundcore and make sure Bluetooth Access is enabled3. Turn the speaker on, pair to the phone via Bluetooth and start playing music4. Open the Soundcore app on the phone5. In the Devices section, scroll down to the Motion Series, find Motion Boom icon and click on it to activate on this phone*** How to Set the Custom EQ ***1. With Motion Boom selected. click on ""Device Settings"" on the App2. Under the word Equalizer, click on ""Soundcore Signature"" … a new view opens with four Preset EQ options (none of them are very useful in my opinion)3. Click on the small, grayed-out word ""Custom"" in the right bottom corner … a Graphic Equalizer appears with 9 adjustment points4. Move the sliders to something resembling the photo in this review … my custom ""mid-scoop"" curve which makes changes in these areas:80 Hz: up a bit - enhances deep, low bass300 & 600 Hz: down a lot - cuts ""boomy"" upper bass1.2 & 2.5 kHz: sharply down - mid-range cut for smoother sound9 kHz: up a bit - boosts treble ""sparkle"" without adding harshness*** Notes ***To prevent physical damage, many Bluetooth speakers including the JBL Xtreme 3 use electronic circuitry to limit bass output at high volume. This can create unpleasant ""compression artifacts"" … odd, flattened dynamics & popping sounds on peak transients. By comparison, the Motion Boom's deep bass is effortless & relaxed, with no noticeable artifacts.In addition to the custom EQ, this is one of Motion Boom's most remarkable features … music sounds warm, full and unprocessed. It makes me think I'm listening to a small home stereo, not a portable speaker.Motion Boom's high capacity 10,000 mAh battery is rated for 24 hour run time. It can also be used as a power bank to keep cellphones alive during power outages (plug the phone's charge cable in the USB-A connector in the back of the speaker, under the waterproof flap)A USB-A to USB-C charging cable for the speaker is in the box but you need to provide your own USB-A wall charger. With a battery this big, its much faster to recharge with a MacBook or iPad charger, not a small iPhone cube charger. Or buy an Anker charger like the PowerPort 2 Elite.With the rear rubber flap fully closed, it's waterproof and floats if dropped in water (great for days at the beach or swimming pool)If you want to splurge, buy two and pair them together as dedicated ""Right"" and ""Left"" channel speakers by pressing the TWS (True Wireless Stereo) button.I hope this review is helpful.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2021",AFFUKQKLKOMT4MYTEI52X4ILRPIQ,1,17,Color: Black

R2ERBUN36N4C82,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Bought this instead of the jbl xtreme 3!,H B,4,"If you need a speaker for a vehicle that has no car radio, you'll need at least a 30w speaker that can hold its own bass wise, as vehicle interior size is small, and roadnoise quite often drown out the bass of smaller sized speakers.Initially I had purchased the JBL Extreme 3 speaker, which undeniably sounds much better than this speaker out of the box.However, this speaker has 3 redeeming qualities that made it my preferred device, and 2 additional features that surprised me.1- most importantly is price. At half the price, and me using the xtreme 3 at work, the repeating question on my mind was ""what if this speaker gets stolen, or breaks? Can I really afford to lose a $180-250 speaker like this?"". Hence I started looking around for cheaper alternatives, and stumbled on this soundcore anker boom, which has about the same dimensions as the jbl xtreme 3 (fitting perfectly in the dash cubby holder of my company's Mercedes sprinter van).2- Both the jbl extreme, and the soundcore anker motion boom produce sufficient volume, bass, mids and treble to be used in a car or portable speaker for house parties. I'm probably not convinced they will do for outside (yard) parties by themselves, but that's what surprised me about the motion boom: it has a button to pair it with more speakers, like JBL party mode! Meaning, you can connect 2 speakers together on one device. I didn't know that feature existed on the boom too (it does exist on the boom plus).3- out of the box, I was a bit disappointed by the boom's sound quality. And while it was easy to add bass with the bass button, soundcore's speaker has an app, that allows me to adjust the eq quite nicely. All of a sudden the boom sound quality was nearing the jbl xtreme 3! I got about 90-98% of the sound quality, for half to 1/3rd the price!4- The JBL Xtreme 3 has a rated battery life of about 14 hours, but after 8 hours at moderately louder volumes (75%), the battery indicator was at about 1/3rd, indicating me there's less than 12 hours of music, and less each time the battery degrades. The motion boom has a rated battery life closer to 24 hours, but my experience playing at louder volumes is closer to 14 to 18hours, which can span 2 or 3 workdays. Another win for the boom!It's amazing that the boom can be relatively loud (75% volume), and my 5v 1A usb charger can keep up with the charge, meaning, on average this 30W speaker only uses about 5W of continuous power, and closer to 10W continuous at close to max volume.Conclusion:The sound quality was nearing the jbl xtreme 3, and volume wise the boom was actually louder, at nearly 1/3rd the price, and I was able to make the boom less sharp sounding than the xtreme thanks to the built in eq of the app, as well as adjust my sound for different music styles, and save the presets, something jbl doesn't offer in their app.The cheaper price also is less of a loss in case stolen or broken, and the battery life of the boom was better, sounding better in the higher frequencies when playing back lower bitrate (<144kbits) of mp3 files.The boom like most Bluetooth speakers, doesn't play compressed audio natively, so you'll need an intelligent device, like a phone or laptop to hear any sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AHRXQBON4ZKFMHICQLXN7SIASVKA,1,17,Color: Black

R3639CBRGN74UX,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars #Worthit - A loooong review for dual Boom setup vs Trance Go,DAUN,5,"I finally got both my BOOMS and my TRANCE GO speakers in the mail today and got a chance to hook everything up. This response is super loooooong but, for people like us I think it's worth the read. In short - the BOOMS for the win!! ""Pound for Pound World Champion"" slams again! The Trance Go DOES have more bass.... but not that much really. Honestly I hoped they had more bass for the size & I'm surprised it didn't. It's QUITE a bit heavier than the BOOM for sure. I think taking this out to the park or beach would be much easier with the BOOM. The mids and the highs are louder on the GO but they do sound pretty harsh on my ears. Even with a custom EQ setting. None of us could hang at max inside. Too shrill. My gf and my roommate also said the GO was annoying at high volume but the BOOM sounded really clean and not too ear stabbing at max volume. Both of these tests were using dual speakers. 2 Booms or 2 Go's. Inside both these sound good (favoring the booms) outside the GO's were louder and did have more kick. Mostly mid kick. Honestly I wouldn't say these are party proof for serious party wolves. They can get the job done but compared to my friends Onyx 4 they dont hold up. But I ruled the Onyx series out because of the poor battery, no IPX, and its massive in a backpack. The nice thing about the booms is that you can have 1 person put one in their backpack and someone takes the other to split the load. I do wish that the Boom had a removable handle for easy storage (not my favorite design) I LOVE the handle on the go. It's suuper nice. Oh yeah I got both to play using the TWS or the party cast OR dual audio using the bluetooth feature on my phone. All of them work great. I did have trouble with the directions with the Party Cast with the Go's because the directions SUCK. The Youtube video says to do it one way but it doesn't work! The light doesnt turn blue and it doesnt tell you to double press the button after it blinks. The paper instructions don't tell you to double press either! I had to go to the webpage and read the instructions and do it that way. But it still wasn't correct either. They should really streamline their info. I talked with ANKER and they said you can fill out a forum on their site and a designated team will review all the comments and make changes if they see a need to. So I feel with picky people like us, we can do that and hopefully with the new ""Mega Boom Rave mini Pro 3 Plus Neo Upgraded version 3.2"" they should get it right. :/ There is a micro latency on (with all speakers) videos where you are watching someone's lips. But not too bad. After a while you get over it. I did some 3D spatial audio tests and the booms worked but not the GOs. IDK why? Oh yeah - and one other fun fact is that you can connect the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 (maybe 2 also?) to the same track that is playing on the speakers! So right now my gf is in the kitchen listening to the same mix as me in the office. Thats handy! Hope this review helps you and others also!

R1A5XXKABN3JTA,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Versus Boom+,Esot Eric,5,"Got this and the Motion+ at the same time as I could not decide which was right for me based on reviews. Watched a bunch of videos, but still wasn't sure.Hopefully I can make this simple for those in the same boat, the Motion+ audio quality in the highs is definitely better, however lacks bass. So a very load and clear iPhone/iPad style sound which you don't feel as there isn't real bass. If you are using it for movies/podcasts/audiobooks or anything that is primarily speaking and you want to hear what they are saying, get the Plus.If you are listening to music (especially any electronic/hip hop) then the Boom gives you that feeling from the bass that you want. While using the Plus I would never find myself jamming out, it was more of an audiophile experience trying to hear all the higher notes really clear. When I would play the same song on the Boom though, I would jam out and it feels like a lower quality version of my studio monitors.For me being able to bring this camping/boating and jamming out is something I wanted to be able to do, even though listening to podcasts is probably the primary use. The Boom sounds fine with podcasts (not as good as the Plus), but gives you a boombox style sound for music that the Plus can't get close to. And the second you go outside with these speakers, the Plus falls on its face whereas the Boom is thumping and carrying that sound.In the end I went with the Boom because it seemed more well rounded, the plus really feels like it is made for a specific purpose and I don't fit that purpose. If in doubt I would recommend the Boom to anyone, and only if you think it sounds bad, then give the Plus a shot, but for the majority I think they will prefer the Boom. And don't forget you can set custom EQs on these through the app, do some youtube searches and try out some custom EQs, that is what really made the Boom the easy choice for me.So for the Boom itself, build quality is good, this is my 3rd Soundcore/Anker speaker and they are all very durable and well made. The top handle is really sturdy and a great big handle, doesn't feel like I need to be gentle with it which is a plus as I like to travel with it, and knowing it is waterproof is a relief when in the woods. Battery life is ridiculous, I believe their 24 hour claims, typically I use mine for 1.5 hours when I shower/get ready and I have used it weeks without charging. Not sure I will ever be in the situation to fully test the battery, a full weekend of camping was no problem at all. Also love the Bass Boost button on the device so it's not reliant on the app, for podcasts I turn it off and then when I listen to music I turn it on and it works really well with the EQ setup I like.Only downside is hard to call a downside, but that would be size. If you want bigger sound you need a bigger device, so can't knock it for being big. Just be aware of this depending on your uses, if you plan on having it more stationary make sure it will fit.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2022",AHA7WK2SN76CQDHCUKZP3IJMN34A,1,10,Color: Black
R164ZQBKGNXY2V,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Actually 4.5 stars because nothing is perfect.....but,Mossydog,4,"Great speaker-s, good base, crisp highs, good midrange, works well in a home theater setting, and the background noise or theme music doesn't obscure the actors speaking. It also comes with an app that includes a graphic equalizer, so you can customize the sound to fit whatever space you are in at the moment.The sound quality when listening to music is good by itself, but it really shines when you pair with another Soundcore speaker. I just got my second one and the stereo quality is as good as any I've ever heard. I'm a bit of an audiophile and have owned a lot of good quality stereo and quadrophonic equipment. I also build computers and it sounds as good, or close enough to, any home entertainment system I've ever built It can be a bit tricky to pair and the app won't install on my chromebook (I exist on small portable devices like tablets, TV's, phones and the like, having ditched the Microsoft world years ago) but it does on Android phones, so no worries there, and once you figure out how your speakers pair....there are a couple of ways I've found and it is different on different devices, so I won't go into it here, but it's not difficult no matter what.I tend to charge my speakers after each use, but I haven't run either of them out of charge yet and I sometimes use them all day and on TV at night, so they last basically forever.I bought both of mine on sale, so for a total of 120 bucks, I don't know that there is any better portable music or theater sound system out there, and I've checked, so in my mind this is a an excellent value and one that I will recommend to friends and colleagues. All things considered, A solid high quality choice and a good value, one I'm comfortable recommending.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AEP3XUFZU2L2Q6IXDYGY2RNEVNLQ,1,4,Color: Black

R2KLQL4FP1QI50,B08LQNL42Z,"5.0 out of 5 stars Insane bass, lightweight, customizable eq, great sound quality, good battery",Philip Bourke,5,"This speaker I snagged for $80 and it is easily one of the best portable speakers for bass. I previously had the Bose soundflex but it didn’t have enough bass for me (while the sound quality was insane, I love bass and wanted more). I thought I might be sacrificing sound quality for bass by switching from the Soundflex to the Motion Boom but I can’t say I really have lost any sound quality but rather actually gained some. I also considered getting a JBL speaker but I wanted something that really packed a punch with bass and risked this one. Insane what you get for the price.Unless you are planning on spending a lot of money, I would definitely recommend this one.The handle makes it super portable. Not very heavy.The battery life is as advertised.The customizable eq is what makes this sound really good. Out of the box it is decent, but I would try these following settings to get insane bass without sacrificing sound quality:Hertz: Slider80 +8150. +4300. -1600. -21.2k. +12.5k. +25k. +69k. +613k. +1This can all be done with the soundcore app. The hertz is on the x axis of the equalizer and the +/- is the adjustable line in regards to the y axis.I always listen with the bass boost on. I also highly recommend placing the speaker right up against a wall or in a corner to amplify sound and bass.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AF5C2HI2OXOKIRNTPMCB2DDEB5XA,1,1,Color: Black
RWNAWY8OHYJA,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars I like it!,DJ EJ ones,5,"Edit: I did a little custom paint job with my Motion Boom. It involves delicately removing the 2 side pieces. Removing the speaker grill. Separating it from the plastic. Sanding down the black paint. And spraying it with your prefered color. Which brings to mind the one thing that this speaker could be lacking is different color choice options. Anyways here is an idea. If you attempt I recommend to turn it off first, be gentle, take your time, and start removing the 2 side pieces in the back in case you make any scratches you won't have to see them from the front.Great portable bluetooth speaker. Looks cute, has a useful handle, charges via USB C, and can charge your phone (at a crawl, but enough for an emergency) through the USB A port. The sound is good, and even better after you adjust the EQ to your preference.I advise that you download the Soundcore app to your phone to adjust the EQ and to quickly update the firmware.Also a quick perusal of the quick start guide is advised so that you know what's what with your speaker and so that you don't complain about not being able to skip songs via the speaker in your review like another review did (to do that you just double press the Soundcore play/pause button).It's a fun device that should satisy almost anyone who uses it correctly (again update the firmware and set the EQ to your liking). You can also use it in concert with another device of the same model, the device has a dedicated button for that function to make it easy. Haven't used that yet but from what I've read it sounds even better and louder than one alone.I remember reading a review complaining about the battery life. That has not been my experience. Battery life is more than adequate. I think this person may have recieved a lemon. These things happen. In these types of cases you should exchange it if you still can through Amazon. If not contact Souncore as the device comes with an 18 month warranty. I myself got the speaker on sale and the 3 year warranty was only $10 so I got that for added peace of mind. But with the water proof/resistance rating and the very solid build I don't anticipate needing to utilize the warranty.Overall, very pleased with my purchase. If you want something that gets even louder, sounds even better, and has dust/dirt protection in addition to watter resistance than I advise you to get the Motion Boom Plus. That one is more expensive and not quite as easily portable but that will be the correct choice for some folks.Best of luck to you and have fun with your speaker. And be mindful of neighbors.

R2EEB94JSH5H0R,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid built speaker with good sound,Ellie84,5,"I bought this to replace the soundbar sitting on my workspace desk. I needed something portable that I could also use when I go camping with the kids. This fit the bill and the price was on point. The sound quality is better than I expected and the fact that you can have multiple units synchronized is even better.The overall feel of the speaker is hard plastic with a mesh cover over the front of the speaker, but this doesn't detract from the quality of the item. I haven't tested the waterproof rating so cant speak to that but I am presuming that the hard plastic feel is due to the waterproofing.As far as sound quality goes this is a 30w system and pushes a decent bass feel. I tried different genres of music and the best quality came in on pop/rnb/dance with rock a close second place. It does get a little scratchy on the treble at higher volumes but if you're not planning on max volume you should be fine.Easy to setup and no issues out of the box.

R1B7JZIMRSYHCR,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Speaker I Have Ever Used,Randy Neves,5,"After searching for a bit I decided to give Soundcore a shot, and I am blown away with the quality that I got for 90$. I have owned UE, Bose, Beats, JBL and several other brands, and the only brand I can say comes close is UE, but for 90$ you can buy a speaker that competes with these high end brands at a cost of a 1/3 of them, and get something that although is a plastic body, is durable, water proof with the ability to float. This speaker has good weight to it, lighter than what I was anticipating, and in a good way. The implemented handle is something I love and makes carrying it distances much easier than having to hold it in both hands or get a carry on case. As well as having a battery life that can last 24 hours, this speaker outshine majority of the competition out there.The speaker has several buttons on it, such as volume up/down, with the pause button in the middle using the Soundcore app logo, which I didn't know when I first got it, but upon finding out thought it was a nice touch. There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, as well as a ""party mode"" button labeled TWS which allows users who own multiple Soundcore speakers to pair up to 100 speakers together! (This is something I will test in the future, and will be sure to edit this review if I remember lol) And finally there is a BASS button which can enable/disable bass, which IMO is a brilliant feature just for having that functionality available. (it is recommended to keep bass on for it makes the sound quality much better, but it is nice to have that dedicated button)As for sound quality, out of the box it is okay, the highs are decent, but what separates this speaker from other brands is the app. The app is extremely well made, with the ability to having custom EQ settings with some presets that can help those who are not experienced with toggling EQ settings. Another feature I love is that Soundcore works LUM who is the streaming partner of Soundcore. With LUM you have access to smaller less known artists, and I love the idea of not only being able to find new artist, but for those who don't have a music subscription like Spotify, or Amazon Music, Soundcore can allow users a way to stream music all for FREE! My only gripe with the app is the inability to change tracks if you are using a different streaming app, but its a very minor issue, than doesn't change my opinion on this app and speaker.Overall this speaker is worth the money, and I recommend this to anyone who wants another option from these bigger companies that tend to focus on marketing instead of making good speakers. I love this speaker and will be sure to buy more Soundcore products in the near future!","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2021",AFW4OEVJATBFASN4BJGYRC6IY6CA,1,0,Color: Black
R3R8KR5JEIQM4F,B08LQNL42Z,"5.0 out of 5 stars Look no further, just get it. (Update) So nice, I bought it thrice.",Just Me,5,"Quick story. I purchased two Harmon Kardon Go + Play Speakers for my wife. One for my wife's home yoga studio where she teaches and one for her home massage therapy room where she performs licensed massage therapy on her clients. I got them both on sale for 180 each which IMO was a steal. (HK msrp of 400 is insanely inflated, but I would pay up to 220 for these guys)My wife also performs licensed massage therapy at a spa with another owner and teaches yoga once a week at an outside gym. I did not want the HK go+play speakers to travel so I started researching budget speakers on YT. I first tried the Bugani M90 which comes in around $50. It wasn't a terrible speaker, had presence and was sparkly, but the lows/bass imo were completely lacking compared to the reviews. It went back. I then went back and forth on the motion boom and the motion plus. I'm no audiophile, but again, IMO the boom just has that warmth and presence from the bass that the motion plus lacks. It just warms up the room. And with the eq mode app from Soundcore, you can fine tune it to get really really close to the motion plus clarity but still gain the low end bass.Alot are excited that Anker crammed five speakers in the plus, but I would almost be willing to bet in a blind test and listen, if the listener had no visuals and never saw these speakers and heard them playing side by side they would probably go with the boom cause it's a room filler, has low end and just sounds all around fantastic.Looks - honestly the boom is a little ugly and cheap looking with the plasticy body and fugly handle.....But, don't judge a book by its cover. This ugly guy sings.So, the boom is going to go back and forth between my wife's away location at the spa and location at the gym because it pumps enough where she can use it at the gym when teaching. Ambient music used during yoga seems to use a lot of low end frequencies for meditation.Also, Im not losing HK go play money on a speaker if someone takes it. Is the boom as good as her HK go play? Nope. Is it good enough that it can still get the job done at half what I paid for the go play and still bring a smile to my face. Absolutely. For less than a large bill, look no further. The boom is a mini bumper that sounds amazing. Awesome job, Soundcore. Update. Loved this thing so much I purchased another to go back and forth from garage to pool.Update again: Purchased another. Taking the garage/pool one (2nd) and the third one on the stand up paddle boards and linking them up when on the lake with my wife.Also, pairing two of these together puts these speakers in beast mode. Sound linked up together fantastic. If you can, try to catch them on sale when they are 75-80 each. Unbeatable.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2021",AGT6C2Q5EXBXLONWA6ZGOSUGSQBA,1,17,Color: Black

RJA4EU91P465K,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars I REALLY TOP NOTCH QUALITY AND VOLUME SPEAKER,DTR6484,5,Yes indeed! I was on the fence with this purchase; and I was thinking about spending twice the cost for a better guarantee of loud clean Bluetooth speaker action. I grew up before the EarPods and earbuds current era that makes great sense. But my old school self doesn’t feel right unless I have some blowback from the speakers playing. We had near concert custom made mega speakers and the best vinyl tech possible. The volume was how we escaped into a world of personal intake of the 70’s——So I have had many good Bluetooth speakers that have worked well but still I have been often bummed by the volume if not the integrity of the music when playing from a equalizer from the App Store. Now especially with the lyrics available on Apple Music… it just was a focus upon the EarPods that kept the speakers from working the way this one does. With the brilliance of such EarPods as Jabra and the inclusion of an equalizer specific to the EarPods… things are getting it right and not depending upon third party apps for the boost in bass and sound. This is a great selection for the current selections of awesome new Bluetooth speakers. I have been an Anker fan since I first bought a very small electicity Bluetooth speaker that blew my larger speaker away. Anker either designed this first version of the many too come circular 360 º small speakers that are still excellent. But this is next level for a reasonable price. Less than $100 delivered isabout what I have paid for several name brands that were good but not like this good. The app that you can download is really simple and nothing to worry about having to mess with and go through the pain of exact or weird settings. The basic equalizer setting is perfect. The sound is crisp and loud enough. It still isn’t close to the 7 feet tall speakers of ‘72… but the ability to just play your music from the Apple app makes this very nice. I am betting that the Sonos and the new Sony and JBL all crank massive great volume and texture. But I would not worry about paying an extra chunk of $$ unless you are a total OCD music person who has no limits. My brother is like that and he doesn’t even shop for the Sam reason that he goes to the brand new and continues upgrading. But even though I spend a considerable amount on new products that are? This time I really feel that this was a great deal and bravo to Anker. They just keep getting better and stay affordable.,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2021",AF7T7ZHBGF24JVDBTF6T73MTLY3Q,1,0,Color: Black

The bass, treble and mids are all relatively good for a high quality sound system. I'm not an audiophile, so the sound quality is good enough for me. My only gripe is that it doesn't have a headphone jack, which surprised me seeing as phones these days that have a headphone jack do very well with liquid submersion, and could've easily been added as one of the ports behind the rubber door in the back with the USB ports. That way, the port is still protected from liquid and dust anyway. There's also no mention of the fact that this speaker doesn't have a headphone jack, which would've been nice to know before I bought it. Also, as another reviewer here mentioned, I, too find it weird that there's no backlighting for the play/pause button as well as the volume up and down buttons, which definitely makes adjusting the volume a bit cumbersome.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AHWXXOQJTMJQCL57GMS7X4KKHAHA,1,1,Color: Black

A couple of things kept me from giving it five stars though.,Kindle Customer,4,"I’ve had this for three months now, and here are my thoughts.First off, this sounds amazing! I love Anker products. I have used their keyboards, charging cables, wall chargers, and headphones. I’ve had my, Anker Soundcore Life 2 Neo headphones, for almost three years now. I’m pretty picky about sound quality, but also on a bit of a budget. Back in 2020, my husband got me the headphones, which I thought I would keep for a few months, and replace with something better. Three years later, and I’m still happy with them, so I thought, i’ve been happy with all of my other purchases from this company, especially my headphones, this has great reviews, so why not take a chance on this speaker? Oh. It was on sale too! That also helped me decide.Last week was the Super Bowl, and my husband and I listened to the game on the speaker. It sounded great! I listen to a wide variety of music, and so far, this speaker has performed pretty well. I’m also surprised at how long the battery lasts in this thing.Now, here are a couple of things that I don’t like about this speaker. First of all, unlike with the headphones that I have, where you can skip backwards and forwards through the tracks, you’re not able to do this with the speaker. That’s kind of inconvenient if my phone is in a different room, and I’d like to skip a track or something.The only other complaint that I have about this speaker is, I wish that it was easier to adjust the sound, and the equalizer.I wish that there were buttons to do it on the speakers, or Sliders that were easier to use with voiceover through the app. I am totally blind, and if you don’t like the presets, it’s kind of hard to get it adjusted just right.Thanks to the reviewer who posted a diagram of how it should be adjusted for optimum sound, my husband, who is cited, was able to do it for me through the app.Overall, I am very pleased with this speaker. I’m glad I didn’t waste big money on a Bose. My daughter has one, and I think this little speaker sounds better than her way more expensive one.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2023",AEYIVZMSSWUGEELX53QPMIQGNXSA,1,17,Color: Black

Additionally, Anker is an EXCELLENT company whose customer service is commendable.

R14BXDXQJFJFLC,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow. An extreme value!,Justin Time,5,"Is this the greatest thing I've ever heard? Nope. HOWEVER For the price this is an extreme value and in a lot of instances ""good enough"". I find in bluetooth speakers I'm normally hoping for either more clarity, more volume, or more bass.So indoors the volume on this thing far exceeds your needs. I like it loud and I am not shy about turning up the volume. I can say inside this thing has more volume and I wouldn't turn it up all the way. Part of the reason is it starts to distort some, not horrible but it's there.When being used at 75% volume which is plenty loud it maintains clarity and its loud everything below 75% is very nice. Highs lows and mids are present and accounted for.The bass... I can say it does have a nice meaty bottom end to it, but.... It's nice bass for two passive radiators, and two 3 inch drivers or whatever they are. Meaning it won't and can't compare to my home theater setup with a 15"" sub. I don't want to dismiss this though because as I say I'm normally always wanting more bottom end. And while it sounds like deep mids and they are a little muddy hey... They are there!The thing kind of has a cheap feel to it, but hey man the price reflects this. They have put their money where it counts which is in the hardware itself. While it feels cheap it's perfectly functional and has a usable feel. Meaning scratch the outside... Meh. I don't care. Drop it and would it shatter or crack... Maybe but I doubt it.I've been trying everything I can think of for the ultimate speaker that is still reasonably portable but still puts it out. I own a Minirig 2.1 setup and that is the gold standard, however it's fiddly to setup and cart around. I've auditioned a Marshall Tufton, and Stockwell, most of the Jbl lineup, Bose, and all of them have failed in some area or another. The Tufton was great but at 11 pounds it just isn't realistic to cart around. I'm just looking for something I can grab and take it to the pool and not worry about it, be able to jam all day, and it doesn't leave me wanting for sound... I know pretty much just perfection. This speaker may very well be the one. It's not perfect but for a grab and go and at the price it is 100% impossible to fault this thing. She is a real sweetheart.Go get you one or two and proceed to use and abuse it.

R12XW1BWH5UJ7N,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bluetooth Speaker on Amazon for under 100.00,Joe K.,5,"I am an audio visual installer, I like to get the best quality at the lowest price!!I Bought (5) 4.5 star plus rated speakers to Compare Quality and Sound. …priced from 50-100 dollars.I was looking for a great sounding speaker for both indoors and outdoors that had great sound for less than a hundred bucks. I have owned many portable Bluetooth speakers over the years that I have spent upwards of $500 for There are so many options available on Amazon. I bought five different speakers ranging from $50-$100. This Anker speaker with integrated handle was tops ! If you download their app, you can customize the equalizer sound for the type of music you’re listening to. Which made the speaker sound so much better than out of the box. None of the other speakers had this option. Many of the other speakers Highlighted dancing lights, multi directional sound, and the ability to hook up multiple speakers for party mode. Although that sounds great, I need one good mobile speaker that I could take to the park, to the patio, and even to the beach. This speaker has great sound and amazing power for the size. The speaker was far superior to the others— I don’t want to slam other brand names but some of them were by name most of us have heard of. . This speaker is IPX7 waterproof, not splash resistant…it has a charging port to charge your phone if you’re running low on juice, and it has great customizable sound. The other speakers sounded good. But the high end sounded flat on almost all of them, Especially if there was any bass sound present. . This speaker is truly a great value for the price point! Also, the Bluetooth range is great.It’s made very rugged. It’s a little bit bigger than the other speakers but very easy to slip into a bag. I’ve included a picture so you could see a good representation of the size of the speaker while I’m holding it And when you hear the quality you understand why I like it. Don’t forget to install the app to customize the sound to your taste and music. For those of you who don’t know the Anker brand…Rest assured, they make quality products !

R29HXOVZ9UQV81,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars enough BOOM for the buck,jim,4,"To me Anker is synonymous with quality, reliability and value...kinda like a honda. I never feel ripped off buying Anker products.You're looking at this item for the bass and if you've used any of Anker's Soundcore products, you know that they use the passive radiator to great effect and create bass out of 'thin air'! The Motion Boom delivers and even in an outdoor setting, it creates enough bass that even at a pool party for 28 fourteen year olds, there was enough audio entertainment and 'boom' up to 5 yards away. You're not going to 'feel' it from there but it's loud. Subjectively, I'd say you can feel the bass up to 3 yards if your standing in the right places. Indoors is same but you can feel it everywhere.Batterylife is 'so-so'; at ~80% max volume for 4 hours battery went from 100% -> 50%. I was expecting a lot more.Bluetooth connectivity was great, I was wandering around 20-30 yards away and signal/sound never dropped.Sound quality is ok...this one is about going loud and boomy while still delivering solid mids and highs, and to do that you're going to have to use the custom settings in the app. fyi: that bass button isn't as effective as a custom profile. I don't have a Motion+, nor have I ever heard one but I'll take it on review that the audio quality is better over the Motion Boom and I took it on review that the Boom was better for outdoors...and I'm happy with my choice.Build quality; as you expect with all things Anker is very good. Everything feels solid.Warranty: if you've ever had to deal with Anker customer service you know it's awesome!Results: 4 stars. I kinda reserve 5 stars if you can compare to competitor products at 2x-3x the price (in this case JBL Boombox2 or PartyBox100), so my apologies to those of you who think this deserves 5.

It has performed admirably, and the battery still lasts many hours. I generally am listening to podcasts or quiet music while working- in that scenario, I can go many workdays before charging it. We have also used it for parties, playing music pretty loudly, and it easily lasts five hours or more. When me or my kids feel like blasting some music, it still works great and the sound is fantastic.In August 2023, we had a large party at our clubhouse, and I thought the one unit alone might not quite cut it. So, I bought a second and paired them... and was blown away, pretty much literally. Together, the volume, base, clarity and stereo sound is vastly improved from the already great single unit. We placed them on each side of a ~30X25 foot room filled with lots of people, and the sound was fantastic, especially after I altered the equalizer on the app. The pair lasted about 5 hours at very high volume playing bass-heavy songs, and still looked to have a good amount of battery left according to the app.I just can't speak highly enough of these units- the sound they produce out of such small, high quality package is incredible.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AGVGSDZHQIWJLKWSX2SGGSJX5QTQ,1,11,Color: Black

R1PLAYSCV96DGD,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Lots of bass,DeJay,4,"Most reviews say how loud the Motion Boom is but that means different things to different people. To me loud means I can barely hear the guy next to me. These have a good volume and in a closed room they seem louder but you can still talk over the music. You will need the Soundcore app to access the EQ as the base can drown out other parts of the music. I listen to harder rock music and it felt like the drums were drowned out. Even with the EQ I still can't get it just right. My wife listens to other types of music and she likes the sound.The battery life is good so far. You should fully charge it before using however it doesn't come with a charger. They recommend a charger that supplies 5 volts and 2 amps. I checked the ones I had and found I needed to purchase a new one. I really think they should include a charger.The app tries to make you think you need an account to use it but you don't. I don't like the fact that just because I need to use an equalizer, Soundcore needs my personal information. I would review the app separately but you'll need it and as far as I'm concerned, That makes it part of the product. An SD card slot would be nice and you could remove the microphone as I would never use this as a hands free device.It's louder than most speakers it's size (I haven't heard them all) and sounds better at a louder volume than most. I purchased it on sale and despite it's short comings, I still feel it was well worth the 80.00 I paid for it.

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,1,17,Color: Off White
R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5,"This little speaker surprised me. This “ULT” button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs. Beach proof and clumsy (me) proof.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AHB6M2A23E4MMUH2H364AK7MX5IA,1,12,Color: Off White
RARW9ZM6Q1LZT,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Super impressive sound in a small package!,Franco F,5,"After 10 years of getting tossed around and used in the rain or humid environments, I had to retire my trusty Bose mini sound link 2. I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,1,4,Color: Orange

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,1,13,Color: Off White
R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,1,3,Color: Off White

Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth.

R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,1,0,Color: Forest Gray
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,1,15,Color: Black

Secondly the speaker is THE best looking ""mini"" speaker . So functional the rope strappy thing is amazing. I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip, I think Sony just dropped JBL . The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL.You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking. The way I use it is ULT mode off for podcasts, ULT on for normal music at low volumes and custom on for party mode with MAX bass. if you know how to place this speaker in the room, like higher up you get pure bliss.Love it !","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHI43AKZHAKEPR7CXNMJW3ZJBIZQ,1,1,Color: Off White
R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,1,2,Color: Orange

R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,0,2,Color: Black
R3VJ6HBM3KLRK8,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"First I'd like to say that this speaker has very nice appeal. It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,0,3,Color: Off White
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,0,0,Color: Orange
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXL5KTBD,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,0,12,Color: Black

I am hopeful to sort this soon and I am sure if I contact the manufacturer I would get assistance, but eww phone calls.

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,0,1,Color: Black

Whatever consumer electronics you buy, whether a TV, stereo or whatever, if it has the Sony label on it, you expect it to be good. That is part of the brand.This speaker delivers the quality you'd expect from Sony. I have a number of bluetooth speakers and some are just ok. This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features. But this speaker is very reasonably priced and as I stated, with the Sony brand, you pretty much already know the quality is going to be good. It is.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AGFIFOWHQ5ICDULACEUY5RXBYZJA,0,0,Color: Forest Gray
R3NFO7DBA3ZQJH,B0CXL5KTBD,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, it sounds great. The bass does get deep.",J. Victor,5,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1. I was very disappointed with the ULT7, if you are considering that monstrously overpriced thing go read my review on it.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,0,5,Color: Orange

It definitely pops and is a bit of a wow factor, so if you like more subtle colors for electronics etc. you may want to go with one of the other color options. I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don’t sound good enough to me bc I don’t get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn’t bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it’s nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds! I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness, and I love this speaker so much I don’t really want to get it dirty or wet! But it seems rugged, made out of great materials, and absolutely great to throw in a bag for a trip or mini adventure!

R2F8A2V513X8TL,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Powerful small portable speaker.,Ty,5,"Sony really hit a home run with their ULT line up. Already own the 7 series. Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker.

R222FIJ0NZCL0Z,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Great room-filling sound; bass is really solid,AZ123,5,"I've been really happy with a pair of Sony ULT Wear headphones, so I was interested in seeing if this bluetooth speaker, the ULT Field 1, would be as impressive. It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product. I expect it to be my main bluetooth speaker henceforth, and plan to use it both indoors and out.

I compared the speaker to my two current favorites in size range, the Klipsch Nashville and the Bose Soundlink Flex, overall both speakers beat the Sony for sound quality. The Klipsch is something special sound wise but is quite a bit heavier in size, the Soundlink has a better out of the box sound, with EQ the Sony come very close. Ultimately the neither is a bad choice, the Sony is 20 dollars cheaper, but the Bose is frequently on sale.

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B08B951D35,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,1,17,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R1N4D4CK1JMIVB,B08B951D35,4.0 out of 5 stars Three + 1/2 stars.,Sophie's6,4,"Feels churlish to give just three stars. 3.5 imo. So to the point. I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,1,9,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B08B951D35,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,1,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music.

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B08B951D35,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,1,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Even though my daughter kept telling me to get a JBL.I love the look of this little Marshall, classic! But, I probably should have listened to my daughter.The sound is decent to good. There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction. This has caused me to slip and call the wrong function and it just feels wrong.","Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024",AFO4OED23PFDXX3AFKZ2T2DRXWIQ,1,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II
R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B08B951D35,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,1,17,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Traveling 90% of the time, I was tired of jamming things in my ears or feeling like I had a sauna on my head with over-ear headphones.I've tested the heavy hitters – B&O, Sonos, Bose, Megaboom (more like Mega Joke), Anker – and had almost thrown in the towel. Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did! The Marshall speaker not only shattered my expectations with its deep bass and distortion-free music, even at volumes that could make my ears bleed.

The lower rating is due to the speaker's inability to go to a really low volume that I wanted for it to be a low key speaker for the bedroom. Also, Marshall allows pairing of speakers to play the same sound, or in stereo, but that apparently is only for when you have two of the same speakers. I have one of their larger speakers that I love, so I was very disappointed that their app doesn't allow pairing of two of their speakers that aren't identical. If you don't care about really low volume music or pairing with a different Marshall speaker, I can't recommend this more highly.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AGQUN3KJYYOJNSILZUNTYO2M6FBA,1,2,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

It is not the gold star of speakers, but the Tribit MaxSound Plus is an excellent, affordable addition to anyone's house.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHSEQIPV3CXTQGVHLAGU4TETUEZA,1,1,Color: Blue
R1NRN0JL66TMT0,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars A Good Sounding, Inexpensive Bluetooth Speaker",John M. Sully,5,"I purchased this product to replace a Logitech X300 I gave to a friend who was facing several months w/o his stereo and only a phone. The Logitech sounded pretty good for my purposes, which is basically replacing hotel room radios. I needed to get a replacement as I will be travelling in a month or so and Amazon had this on a deal, so I snapped it up.I was favorably impressed with the build quality of the speaker when first unboxing it. It feels solid, with a nice grippy exterior, good heft, and rubber sealed aux and power ports. The speaker is quite handsome, too in its elegant oval form and basic black color scheme. It is a little bit wider than the Logitech, but not as high. The buttons on top of the unit are glossy black on flat black and are easy to see. The one drawback is the multifunction ""Play"" button whose function varies depending on how many times you press it. Press once and you pause, press twice to skip forward a track, press 3 times to skip back. And everything changes if a call is coming in. Oh well, I usually use the phone for these functions anyway. Pairing with my phone was cake, put the phone into pairing mode, press the Bluetooth button, select the speaker as the device on the phone, and accept the pairing request. Easy, peasy.But this is a speaker and no matter how nice it looks or how reasonable the UI, how does it sound? First remember that this is a fairly cheap Bluetooth speaker and it has its limitations. I didn't expect it to sound as good as my ZVOX Soundbase that I use as a Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom when I am not using it as a speaker for my TV. I also didn't expect it to sound as good as the HEOS 3 wireless speaker I use in my office. And I certainly didn't expect it to sound as good as my main 5.1 system in my living room. That being said, it did not disappoint. The sound was quite a bit more lively than the Logitech. Without the XBASS turned on the bass is solid and balanced with the midrange and treble. Overall, the sound is pretty good, much better than the Logitech. However, on dense mixes the sound can get a little muddy, I heard this on some afro-beat stuff I listened to with lots of horns. I wouldn't hold this against it too much, since these sorts of tracks are difficult for just about any reasonably price speaker of any size. Dense horn mixes are hard. With XBASS turned on the bass becomes artificially bloated and tends to muddy the sound. This might work for bass heavy music but did not work for my ears.Overall, the sound was quite good for this type of speaker, especially given its price and form factor. I gave it four stars for sound quality in the universe of small speakers I have had experience with. In it's class, it gets five stars. For my purposes, replacing a lousy hotel radio, it is superb.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020",AG23CZT7Z27IPZUEBQRGYX5NOAHA,1,7,Color: Black
R3JPI4WNEZC4A3,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I Never Know What to Expect........,Alphadog,5,"I never know what to expect when purchasing a sound device because I have hearing problems (highs are gone). I've learned to accept what I get most of the time. Before this purchase I was using a Philips 2 speaker bluetooth portable speaker which was giving me somewhat acceptable sound but lacking in definition. The reason for replacing it was because it was no longer reliable, having some power problems.I decided on the Tribit MaxSound Plus mainly because of the reviews. After all, I can't hear it through Amazon. I've had it now for just over 2 weeks and I'm loving it. I thought I would never use the Xbass but I actually leave it on all the time. It seems to give it the fullness it needs without overwhelming you with heavy bass. Super surprised and pleased!! The unit powers up and connects via bluetooth rather quickly. The bonus is that it actually does give you a 100 foot range (or more) on the bluetooth which was another surprise. This unit doesn't let things like walls or even buildings get in the way of reception. My Philips wasn't much distance at all and sometimes cut out if I just moved around. So, for the sound itself and the bluetooth range, I love it so far.But, there's always something I don't like so here it is........My Philips was about the same length but, it was thinner and lighter. I could slide it into my back pocket for example. No way in heck you can do that with the Tribit. It's HEAVY and kind of a round/triangle shape. No way to slide it into my pocket, any pocket (except a coat maybe). Also, the controls on top are almost invisible. The volume control on the Philips was easily turned up or down with a knob. The Tribit has a ""control panel"" on top that is like ""embossed"" so you can ""feel"" it I guess. You can hardly even see the controls because they are the same color as speaker enclosure. I'm turning it up and down frequently as well as pausing/changing songs and if I can't see what I want easily, it's no fun at all. I'm trying to learn the ""feel"" so I won't have a problem. BUT, if you want to turn it down quick, you're out of luck. Finding and pressing the + or - to increase or decrease the volume is not a good thing. Like my Philips, it too needs a knob of some kind. If nothing else, IT NEEDS A KNOB for volume only. The rest doesn't matter.I suppose the reason it's SO heavy is because of the great battery power. I have no idea how long it lasts (they claim it's 20 hours) but, I haven't run out of power yet between uses. One thing that doesn't matter to me so much but, it might bother others, is the fact that there is a LAG on the bluetooth like most products. Of course, you won't notice unless you are using it for videos.Also, I've had trouble skipping to the next song, or worse, the one after that. I end up changing it on my phone instead. I feel sure it's mostly me but still, not good.One last note.... A few times my song would speed up or something and sound weird but, not sure what that's all about. My phone or the Tribit??? Who knows. Maybe I can elaborate later.It's only been 2 wks so I'll update if the whole thing turns south but, for now, I believe it's a KEEPER mainly because it sounds so good to me!!!!!! Remember, I have hearing problems.Manufacturer.....Please put a volume knob on it and it will be almost perfect!!!!","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2019",AGNCDBEVENI6OYJHT3LFNZOAHHSA,1,5,Color: Black
R1VWFUTQFI7I4L,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for the price!,Ismael Negron,4,"I have to first admit that I am a fan of Tribit. I got my first bt speaker from them a few years ago (a StormBox Pro, the black in the picture) during a Black Friday sale, and like it so much that eventually I ended up owning three!Anyway, so my daughter lost one of the SBPro's at Coachella last year, and I've been thinking about replacing it. When I saw this Tribit Max Sound Plus model on sale my interest was picked. I liked the ""pill"" form factor, that it came in blue (my daughter's favorite color), and the price was right.I have using it for about a week now and it pretty much parallels the pro's and con's of my other Tribit device. The sound quality is excellent for a device of this size. The bass is weak unless you turn on the X-Bass mode, and then it is good. Not as ""bumpy"" as the Bose SoundLink Mini, but at about a 7th of the price, it is great. The BT is strong and reliable (never had any issues), it keep playing in my basement office even when I went upstairs to my room. What I really like about Tribit is their ""Party Mode"", which allows multiple devices to be linked to play the same content, so you can place a bunch of them around an area and still cover it with soft music. I have enjoyed ""Party Mode"" with the SBPro's, but not the MaxSound Plus, since I currently own just one. However, my wife want to get one for her sister, so I will get a second one soon.The fact that it is IPX7 rated makes it perfect for use where it might get wet, or even submerged (up to 3 feet)...it does not flote, so... be careful.The battery does seem to take a while to fully charge, but last the whole fricking day (over 15 hours).Bottom line:Great sound with good bass (with XBass activated), strong BT connection, has a microphone for calls, waterproof but does not float.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AED4VFHZR77VDBOMHOSZET4ITYFA,1,2,Color: Blue
R1E7BM5FBFYZI6,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars No regrets with this speaker. Excellent for its price.,Kelly,5,"I bought the Tribit MaxSound Plus for $60 at the time, and my expectations were as such, but I was more than impressed. Out of the box, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it felt. It's got the well-built mass one can appreciate by just holding it. It lends to a respectable amount of grip because of the rubberized matte finish over the whole thing. Its got a minimalistic black metal grill that sits flush with its contours and a cord lanyard for easy lugging around.The battery lasts quite a long time. I've used it over a month, 2-4 hours a day at a medium to loud volume level, and I've only had to charge it maybe two or three times. It charges via a USB-C port in the back, with the aux input right next it.The sound quality is very good. This is a $60 (at the time of writing) speaker we're talking about. And it's really, very good. There are 3 EQ modes: clean, XBass, and audiobook mode, which are indicated by LED. Music and audio playback is appreciably crisp, and is not distorted even at higher volume levels. While I will not praise (nor am I credible to say so at any rate) the speaker's range of frequency (especially how I wish there was just a teensy bit more treble dynamic range), it does a spectacular job of bringing balance, clarity, and tone, all where they need to be. And the oomph. Oh, the oomph. The lows are satisfyingly heavy for a small-form speaker and punchy enough without taking away from the overall balance.The Bluetooth is Bluetooth - I won't get into depth about it because Bluetooth tends to be atleast similar versions across platforms. But it's good. Only thing I'd gripe about is the speaker's relatively short timer turning off during inactivity, which can be annoying, because you would have to physically get up and press the speaker on again.Although I wouldn't bring this speaker for heavy-duty or ""rugged"" activities like camping or going to the beach, this speaker is perfect for casual listening and home or office/work use. It's powerful without being overwhelming, and it delivers. I'm very happy with my purchase. The Tribit MaxSound Plus is absolutely the bangin' for its buck.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2022",AENIUCNBAXSGADOA7G4AWSYVA5HA,1,14,Color: Black

R3FUSDIONHGXG6,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Overall the best out of the 3 Tribit speakers I tested,RJM,5,"The media could not be loaded. I purchased all 3 Tribit products, StormBox Micro, Stormbox and Maxsound Plus for my own personal self-testing. I wanted to see if all the good review were true.In comparison to the other two lower models, this speaker has a good overall sound. From the Bass to Mids it sounds great and loud. Like the other models the sound comes off very clean, no static sound what so over or extra noise coming off the speaker grill. I played all different types of music racing from classical, instrumental, pop, hip-hop, rap, bass and rock.Songs played:* Dinah Jane - Bottled Up• Ed Sheeran (Camila Cabello & Cardi B) - South of the Border• Maroon 5 - Memories• Conkarah - Banana* George Winston - Variations on the Canon• Hilary Stagg - Easy Days• Guns n ' Roses - Sweet child of mine• Yiruma - River flows in you• Post Malone - Wow• Beyonce - Love on top• Cardi B - Bodak Yellow• Matisyahu - One Day• Lil Wayne - How to love• Notorious BIG - Hypnotize• Lil Waye - A Milli• Brennan Savage - To the MoonI didn't play it at 100% but at 75% it still sound clean and the speakers didn't sound like it was gonna pop. It plays the classical/instrumental songs as if it were a Bose speaker. This is not a surround sound movie theater speaker, but it does give off more of the sound than other models. I'm pretty sure if you get two MaxSound plus speakers it would sound like you had surround sound. I'd love to test two of these paired up.I thought I could pair up any other Tribit bluetooth speaker, but that didn't work. After several attempts It didn't pair up to the StormBox or Stormbox Micros. Another thing about the bluetooth is that I was able to control the song being played on the MaxSound Plus through the StormBox Speaker and the StormBox Micro. When I pressed the circle on the Stormbox or the square on the Stormbox Micro twice, whatever song is up next in the que started playing. When I press those buttons once the current song would be played on the speaker which I just pressed the button on. That feature I thought was neat. Sometimes also, when I play songs on the MaxSound Plus it would automatically switch other to the Micro on its own. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of 5. One thing that I did find kind of annoying while testing the speakers is that I would sometimes start the songs on the MaxSound Plus and seconds later the music would jump on its own to the micro. This happened more than twice. I know that the unit you play your Tribit speakers on remembers the last connections. But I tried having the Stormbox as the last speaker being played as well and it also randomly happened to play from the MaxSound plus to the Stormbox Micro. Please fix this issue.This product has some weight to it and is not light at all so I'd hate to drop it. When held in your hand the material is not slippery and you feel like you have a grip. Some speakers and headphones out there have this same mat finish and after a few year or when you don't use it it gets all sticky and starts to fall apart. I hope that this does not happen to the Tribit speakers. It has a lanyard that you can hold on to or latch it on to something like a back back. I'd probably take an S-Caribner with a bungee and put that in place of what is being used now if I were to hang it on to something like a backpack or bag.Battery seems to be good on the MaxSound Plus. It has an auto shut off feature if it hasn't been playing any sounds. This is also for the case for the Stormbox and Stormbox Micro. The Stormbox frequently turns itself off and I have to keep pairing it with the iPad or iPhone which is annoying. After about 20 minutes of not playing anything the MaxSound Plus is still synced while this StormBox Micro is still playing songs. The MaxSound Plus shuts off around 30 minutes of not being used.For the price this is a great speaker. I will have to update my review, if I get a second pair and try to pair the two same speakers. The Stormbox and Stormbox mini says you can pair two of the same speakers “Party Mode”, but I didn’t see that int he manual. Also this came with an audio cable for those that do not have bluetooth capability.I would most likely keep this, the MaxSound Plus or the StormBox Micro since I experienced bluetooth and power issues with the StormBox. The MaxSound is good for an all day outing even overnight trip. 20 hours of play is awesome!","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2020",AEZPYGQIA7VIEBXX4Z4WGKP7LBMQ,1,17,Color: Black
R1ZICJVEVL4I8Z,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Portable Performer,BDM,5,"You'll notice the heft of this unit right away when taking it out of its packaging. It is surprisingly heavy for its size - much heavier than older bluetooth speakers I have of similar size.The sound quality is very good for what it is. The extra bass mode has its own button, and for my tastes, I've toggled back and forth but prefer to leave it on. Like most speakers, if you can put this near a wall, a back splash on your kitchen counter or bathroom sink, etc., you'll get more sound radiating towards you and the sound will seem to have more depth.Like another reviewer, I bought this case for the MaxSound Plus, and it is a very nice and fairly snug fit, alghough there is still some room above/below the speaker in the mesh, velcro sealed compartment for a few cords and other small items: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F4J8Q1/I don't have this speaker's little brother to compare it to, but I'll be honest and say that I expected just a little bit more based on the reviews I read... a little more bass, a little more volume - that is, until I did an A/B comparison with some of my older bluetooth speakers. That's when I realized that my expectations were too high, and this speaker is exponentially better in every way than what I had been using.Here are three of the ways I've used this and how it performed:First, I took my sons and their friend to a local field and we practiced shooting soccer balls on a very windy day. I put the speaker on a camp chair about 15-20 yards from where we were playing, and I maxed it out (phone and speaker volumes). It sounded very loud close to the chair, but where we were, it was just a nice background sound. If you're trying to rock a noisy party, then expect to just have some nice sound to hear in the background. If it will be fairly peaceful and you'll be close by, then you can expect to have good volume with a fairly full sound. This speaker has a flat curve to, I believe, around 50Hz. The bass is surprising, but don't expect the feel of a subwoofer - something that can physically move a lot of air and create a lot of sound pressure - especially outdoors.The second is very similar to the first. We used it in the back of my Yukon with the tailgate up on an even windier day (like too windy to talk on the phone windy), and the sound was great as long as we were within 10 feet of the truck or so.The third is what has me most excited. My wife was cleaning the house, and my boys and I wanted to watch a movie. We layed 3 wide on my oldest's bed and streamed Netflix to a 10"" tablet. We used this MaxSound Plus for the sound, wtih the extra bass feature on, and just had the speaker behind the tablet on my lap. The sound quality was full and simply excellent for this purpose, and we never went above half volume on the tablet.If the speaker is connected to a source, you can't take it away, but the MaxSound Plus does have a separate bluetooth button. Just hit it and connect with a different device if you wish.All in all, I'm very pleased wtih my purchase, as this is a nice portable unit that fits most if not all of my needs. Really, the only other speaker I'm considering purchasing to round out my needs is this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WF78GS4/. For the rest, this one has it covered.Let me know if you have any questions. I've built many of my own bookshelf speakers and subwoofers, as well as my own portable bluetooth speaker. I've probably spent between $30k-$40k over the years on audio equipment alone. I know enough to at least try to help out.

RO1DBHSPL36M4,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Blown away by this speaker, but BT buzz/hiss caused me to rate it lower than I wanted to",Xmetal,4,"Update: The problem is still there and so annoying (BECAUSE this would be and ... to be fair still is, along with this speaker's ""little brother"" the XSound Go .... my favorite or at least tied for being my favorite) .. The sound issue still happens but its mainly an issue at lower (like the LOWEST volumes) ... the ""buzzing/bt"" sound is always in the background BUT if you turn the volume up, you will probably not even notice an issue (and the sound of the audio, no matter the EQ setting IS that good) ... I dont want to get nutty with fractions/decimals but i bumped the 3 out of 5 to a 4 out of 5 ... 3 seemed low even with this problem ... i'd say .... a 3 3/4 or 3.75 would be my score ... maybe a 4.5 out of 5 would have been my score (even with lower battery life than the Xsound Go) if it just didn't have that ""buzzing"" or ""hum"" sound. If it were my perfect speaker (the battery life of the XSound Go, but the EQ settings this speaker does have now... i'd give it a 5 out of 5 and i never give that rating out figuring ""something can always be better""---------------------------------I am redoing part of what I had pre-written in a review to post after dealing with Tribit/Tribit’s parent company (they are a blast to deal with) and received a second unit that I just tested with two devices and it not only has the same issue .. it may be worse (louder) … I love Tribit speakers and the same devices with a two Xsound Surfs and two different Xsound Gos (lower on the product line) DO NOT have this issue. The TL:DR of it is a static/buzz/interference issue I keep hearing … the low end LFS speaker I got for $15 years ago is the only one with this same type of buzzing/humm…. OTHER THAN this very annoying issue .. and maybe wishing the battery life was better (The cheaper Xsound Go should not have BETTER battery life in my view) … well other than that .. this speaker blows me away and SOMEHOW is still one of my favorites but due to both having an annoying static/buzz .. my Tribit Xsound GO may still be my favorite model speaker.Pros:- the Sound … OH BOY THE SOUND. They keep taking the lower models (Xsound Surf ~~> XSound Go ~> MaxSound Plus) and making it better. HOW? … I feel the only issue with the Surf or the GO, is that sometimes in some lower volumes, and some genres, it sounds GREAT .. but a little too “boomy” …like a good Subwoofer on a track that doesn’t need a Subwoofer “thump” to the sound. The sound is TOTALLY a “clean” thump/bass but not always needed and to be honest… I have no issue with that really … the sound of the Surf and the Go is so good, I am “yeah I can live with that”.That is where the EQ built into the MaxSound Plus comes in. I have some other speakers or earbuds where there are built in Eqs but they almost seem gimmicky at times. Like maybe one is the best but the others are not that good. This is NOT the case with the MaxSound Plus.Music Mode is the sort of default mode (it DOES remember the last mode it was on, by the way) that sounds good but while I here a good thump in the bass, its not overdone on the tracks I have listened to so far. Bass Mode (whatever they call it) is a better sound than the Surf and the Go, but I’d say the same profile with boosted bass … STILL not overdone where it muddies things up …I have not listening to rap yet on this speaker but I think genres like that may benefit from the extra bass. It’s NOT an extra bass that distorts everything, I’d say .. though I admit I don’t turn these speakers up full volume as that would just be too loud for me anyway.THE MODE THAT SHOCKED ME not because it sounds the best, but because of what I have heard from others who LOVE the MaxSound Plus, but say “yeah … ‘audio book mode’ is useless and you will never use it”… I figured I’d have the same view but I was WRONG. On some jazz/instrumental tracks it sounds great in all three modes and “audio book mode” I think they are calling it is … more of a “flatter” or more balanced EQ where the low and high ends are not overstated.Honestly I have an Ortizan X10 that while I don’t dislike … sounds of even on it’s best EQ setting. honestly … The Maxsound Plus’s audio-book mode sounds better than the “Dynamic” (I forgot if they have a name for it) Ortizan X10 Dynamic EQ mode. Things like in the other two Tribit models I have .. just sound Dynamic BUT balanced and crisp/clear.I know everyone has different experiences (look at the buzz/static issue I mentioned) … but I don’t hear the “sounds like a tin can” or “this sounds terrible .. there is no bass in any EQ mode” sound of the other negative reviews say. It’s that buzz/hum on my units that drive me nuts … everything else sounds GREAT.I did buy mine at a discount and … while I love all of this … I have seen the MaxSound Plus at double the price of Tribit’s XSound GO… “is it worth it?” … eh .. I cant say “no” but also considering that much of a price difference (again that is not what I paid for mine) … the GO is REALLY good too.This may sound odd (esp since I don’t turn up the volume all the way) but … there seems to be a “power” to the MaxSound Plus (the XSound Go is not far off) where it SEEMS like if you want to turn it up and have the same good audio the speaker wouldn’t have an issue with it, .. unlike some speakers you may here where past say 60 or 70% volume things get distorted. Again I have NOT tested this.- Build Quality – this is typical for Tribit speakers and that just means a great build quality- Connection – this connects pretty fast and I have had ZERO hiccups in the sound cutting out or disconnecting … though the battery life not being as long as I’d hope may have caused it to shut off once and the life was showing 50% left when I reconnected.. .not sure what happened thereUnsure thoughts:- Eh I cant say this how low battery life and even if it did, I’d be ok with it up to a point. I know its not what is advertised and my Xsound GO’s seem to last longer..Comments:- this speaker is bigger than the Xsound Go by a little bit and I wasn’t expecting that much of a difference … not a pro .. not a con (unless you really want a small speaker) .. I can live with this.------------------------------------------------------------I am so disappointed in this speaker.. mainly due to the buzz/static sound. I can even live with the battery life thing … the REASON I am so disappointed is that if it did not have that static/buzz (again two different units) .. this speaker MAY get a 5 out of 5 from me .. maybe 4.5 out of 5 due to the battery life being lower then Tribit’s XSound Go. I have to go on my experience with the speaker and give it a lower grade than I want … again if it wasn’t for that buzz (and if I find a way around that with the devices I want to use it with I will post an update, increasing the rating) … this may be a 4.5 out of 5 and one of my favorite speakers I own .. with that issue it … IRONICALLY is still up there. The issue I have had (not in the Xsound GO with the same devices) .. may keep the Xsound GO as my #1 favorite though.I know some who have no issue with static or buzzing (my way of describing it) .. maybe it’s my devices. I WILL NOT say avoid this, but I just note my issue. (really a single issue) … I have to give Tribit/Thousandshores a 5+ out of 5 for support. I … I don’t see myself contacting them about the replacement. I got the first at as discount and the second speaker for free, and .. I think I can live with the issues.Overall the Tribit Xsound Go maybe a better (esp with battery life and cheaper price) bang for your buck, purchase.In case it’s not apparent .. I am more DISAPPOINTED as this is not usually a problem I have with Tribit products and as I said .. without the issue with the buzz, it WOULD BE a co favorite with my Tribit XSound Go's .. mainly because the Go's have a better battery … I DON'T hate the MSP .. I hate the issue I have had with such a GREAT speaker.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,1,0,Color: Black

REN0G6R1Z3D6W,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars Best speaker ever for audiobooks except for one awful design decision,R. C. Jackson,3,"The good: I listen to audiobooks constantly, and the audiobook equalizer setting on this speaker is unparalleled. Most Bluetooth speakers are built for music and are all about maximizing bass, so they are pretty bad at emphasizing the frequencies of an audiobook narrator's voice. I can't say enough about how clear audiobook narration is with this speaker.The questionable: It's early days yet, but it seems that even when listening at moderate volume and with my phone right next to the speaker (so it doesn't have to strain to maintain the Bluetooth connection), the battery life is about 10 hours or so. That's half of the ""up to 20 hours"" advertised. I need more experience with the speaker to verify this, though, so I might be wrong. My old speaker, an Anker, was much smaller and lighter but delivered a solid 18-20 hours of listening on a charge. I thought the Tribit, being much weightier, would have a larger battery than the Anker. I wanted to remove a star for this, but until I've used it more I think that's unfair.The bad: One of the design goals of this speaker seems to have been ""make it as easy as possible to press the Bluetooth pairing button by mistake."" What happens when you accidentally press the Bluetooth pairing button? The speaker enters Bluetooth pairing mode, and the only way to get it out of pairing mode is to power cycle the speaker. They could've designed it so it was a toggle: one press enters Bluetooth pairing mode, a second press exits Bluetooth pairing mode. But they didn't. So if you accidentally press the button, you have to turn the speaker off and then back on and wait for it to connect. Now let's see how they made it super easy to accidentally press the button.First off, the row of buttons is black on black. No contrast whatsoever. In an even a moderately low light situation you'd better know exactly where the button you want to press is located, or be very good at reading the button icons with your finger like Braille.Then there's the placement. The Bluetooth pairing button is immediately next to the most often used button on the speaker: the Play/Pause button. They put a button you'll use at most once a year right next to a button you'll use 30 times a day. Why didn't they put the Bluetooth pairing button off to the side, or any place except right in the middle of the other buttons?Another thing they could've done is require a long press to enter Bluetooth pairing mode. That way if you accidentally pressed it it wouldn't do anything. But, no, an accidental short press is all it takes to send you on a trip down restart lane.I wanted to remove 2 stars for this, but I know that bad UX design bothers me more than most people, so I settled for only removing 1 star. If I could award half stars I would've given this speaker 3.5.Update:1) I have confirmed that the battery life is substandard compared to previous Bluetooth speakers I have owned.2) The battery problem is magnified by the fact that it will not charge while you are using it.3) I've also found a related bug: I have the speaker plugged into power and I'm using it. But because it doesn't charge while you're using it, eventually it warns me that battery power is low. So I turn it off to let it charge. But it doesn't charge. It won't start charging until I unplug it from power, then plug it back in again.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AEQN4UKCDVEDJURABTNPY3EGNEIQ,1,2,Color: Black
RISXQT2QLB8JZ,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Upgraded Tribit MaxSound Plus, Two are Much Better Than One!!!!",newelw,5,"I am a BIG fan of Tribit Bluetooth speakers! I currently own a XSound Go, three Stormboxes, two Stormbox Pros, two Stormbox Micro 2s, two Homes, two Stormbox Blasts, and now I also own three MaxSound Pluses (one original and two upgraded). The ones I am least impressed with are the Stormbox Pros (does not reproduce bass as I expected) and other than the Blast (which is truly amazing), I am most impressed with the MaxSound Plus.I had always wished that you could pair two MaxSound Plus speakers for true stereo, but that was not possible with the earlier versions. Once I saw there was an upgraded version, I watched some videos by Alan Ross Reviews on YouTube and sure enough, you can now pair the upgraded version with the earlier version for true stereo. I received my upgraded version yesterday and the pairing went very well and the sound of both speakers together is wonderful!! If you close your eyes in the sound field, you would never think that all that sound comes from two small speakers.The tests Alan Ross did shows that the performance of the newly upgraded MaxSound Plus is almost identical to the earlier version. The new Plus does have a Music Mode and an Audio Book mode to compliment the XBass mode. Since the speaker is small, I always operate them using the XBass mode to get as much bass as possible, which is surprising for this small speaker. There is also a USB C charging connector on the new version (comes with USB C cable and 3.5 audio cable).Below is the procedure that I used to do a stereo pairing, using one upgraded version and one original version. The instructions in the manual for the upgraded version for doing a stereo pairing does not work with my original version and must be instructions for pairing two upgraded versions:1. Turn on both speakers and assign the upgraded version as your left master/primary speaker.2. Disconnect any bluetooth-paired device from the speakers.3. Press the Bluetooth button on the left master/primary speaker and hold it down until you hear a tone and the phrases ""Stereo Mode"" and ""Left Channel"".4. Connect your bluetooth device to the left master/primary speaker.Note: The instructions in the little manual for the upgraded version says to press the bluetooth button on the right secondary speaker, but every time I did that, it was disconnecting the speakers from stereo mode, so that must be instructions for two upgraded Pluses (can not verify since I do not own two myself).Note: I ended up getting another upgraded MaxSound Plus and can confirm that they do pair very nicely following the normal instructions and once paired, they will auto-pair when both speakers are turned on. I ended up having a bit of an issue in that Tribit shipped me a ThunderBox Plus instead and that appears to be the replacement to the upgraded MaxSound Plus speakers. I did get to confirm that the ThunderBox Plus WILL NOT pair with either the original MaxSound Plus nor the Upgraded MaxSound Plus, even though that new speaker still shows MaxSound Plus on the right rear of the speaker (must be a firmware change). You can tell the ThunderBox Plus by a small recess in the front metal speaker grill.Again, I am a fan of most of the Tribit Bluetooth speakers and bang for buck, they are a great deal.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2022",AGGSMYZJWAVPWGJ3BNWB4CZX2CBQ,1,17,Color: Black

R2WGACHTHXIVJJ,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Speakers bluetooth works,Robin P.,5,"I had a problem, I purchased a nice bluetooth player but if I used it to connect to my cars bluetooth, I couldn't connect my phone. I am someone who enjoys very nice sound for my music and only use HiDef players and FLAC formats for my music. I had been using my USB connector but that only accepted mp3 which compared to FLAC and a nice HiDef player sounds a bit flat. These speakers fit the bill quite well. I added velcro to the bottom and attach them to my dash. I also made a mylar shade to keep the sun from overheating them. I purchased two which gave me stereo sound and 24+24 = 48 Watts of sound. No complaints. These sound almost as good as my internal speakers. Actually, they sound just as good.I have found once you connected them to the player, the bluetooth works flawlessly to connect to the speakers. A few times I have had to turn one off and turn it back on for them to pair together to provide stereo sound. Normally, they work flawlessly. I turn them on before and get it set-up prior to driving down the road. The battery life is claimed to be 20 hours. I have had these on short 30 minute drives to work since I got them and I have yet to have to recharge the speakers. It's been 11 days since I set these up which includes 7 work days. Still no need to recharge them. I also use them whenever I drive to the store or to visit a friend. They work well and are one of the few bluetooth speakers I have found that pair with another to provide stereo sound. They do this almost flawlessly automatically once set-up.I have an HiFi Player that lasts 20 hours on a battery and these lasted longer. Of course I also used the player independently a little. So I am guessing it works as advertised for 20 hours give or take a little bit. I compare the sound from my HiFi Player against other sources and so that is how I judge the sound. I am aware that you can get even better sound from well designed speakers and have very nice speakers for use at home. However, I don't know of too many bluetooth speakers that can pair with others to reproduce stereo sound and sound as good as these. I am not one who goes for excessive bass.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2023",AE5RMQU7IFMMLWUUSSBFP7UGLAMQ,1,5,Color: Black

R2TMWDM387AFJ5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid speaker - updated review,D. Ellis,5,"Original review: Just received this after seeing good reviews. Sound is okay. My 8 year old Anker was better but unfortunately the battery reached the end of its life. Beside the bass being weaker compared to my older and less expensive speaker, my main complaint is that it repeatedly drops connection as soon as whatever you're listening to ends. It does not drop while actively in use, so that's good, but won't stay connected once the music ends. I'm not talking about a 15 minute time out, I'm talking like 15 seconds. Disconnect, reconnect, disconnect, reconnect, repeat until you start music again. It's so annoying. I tried doing the factory reset and that helped for a little bit and it started up again. I'm sitting like 4ft away from my speaker, so it's not a phone to speaker distance thing. Never have had this issue with any of my other Bluetooth devices. Maybe I got a bad one, but probably going to return. Not happy with this especially since it's not super cheap.UPDATE:Changed review from 2 stars to 5 stars. I returned my original speaker, but Tribit customer service reached out to me and offered to replace my purchase free of charge and shipped a replacement directly to me. I have been running the speaker both active and idle for an hour or so now and I have not had any connection drops. I also think that this speaker sounds better than the first one I got. After returning my original speaker, I went with another familiar brand (newer version of what I used to have), and it is smaller and definitely sounds worse than this Tribit. All together I'm glad I gave this one another try. I think I will relinquish my other speaker to being the spare, and this will be my main one. Thanks for the customer service, I didn't expect it!","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AET5AUS5KKNSJTNS5LZOSL2OXVYA,1,2,Color: Black
R3LS36HGF624XS,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Does the job, mostly",Stan A,4,"My primary need for a speaker is to be used outdoors while working in the backyard. I like to be able to move around my 1/4 acre-ish backyard and still be able to hear music clearly. Well, that's a tall task for a small speaker. Obviously a larger speaker is better, but not nearly as portable as this. I've tried A LOT of speakers and had pretty much given up on finding the right one. Well, this one is about as close as any that I've bought (and returned). I believe I'll be keeping this one, unless the performance fades in the comings weeks/months.Pros:- This has a good amount of pleasing bass when nearby. It's not thundering or booming - I mean, it's a small speaker! But there is a nice deep hum that resonates well when you are near it. This would be good for a small, chill gathering on your patio.- The build seems sturdy. Good heft without being heavy, if that makes sense.- Overall good sound profile. Does not distort even at max volume.- The blue color is actually pretty sharp. I prefer black, but this stands out nicely without being annoying to the eye.- This speaker is acceptable for my outdoor needs, but I believe it would be excellent indoors in a small to medium sized room.- I like having a lanyard. Keeps the speaker clean from my dirty landscaping hands.- Battery life seems good. I tend to play it at full volume, and have gotten 10-12 hours out of it.- Good value speaker in performance vs cost.Cons:- It does not project as loudly as I'd like, but it's still audible from across the yard. I wish it had another 10 watts of power, and it would be perfect for my needs.- The lanyard is basically a low quality shoestring. Other speakers have something more rugged like paracord.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2023",AFHFRRJMWINIOJN3JQRIUBMJBPVQ,1,13,Color: Blue

R3TVDEODMDXDE6,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker but frustrating low volume issues (partly an Android problem),Noneya Bizness,4,"I've had my speaker for a few years now and still like it a lot. Sound quality is great, good midtones and bass for a small package and not ""tinny"" sounding at all. I've used it in the shower many times and have never had any issues with water. It's been dropped a number of times and never had any issues.I'm writing this review primarily to point out one flaw, and that is the low volume listening. In general, if you want to have fine control over volume, opt for a speaker that uses a knob instead of buttons. By their very nature, buttons can only increase volume at pre-defined intervals (steps) and there's no fine-tuning possible. If 0% is muted and 100% is maximum, stepping up the volume one time would move it, say, from 0% to 10% or 10% to 20%, etc. That would be a 10% step.When connected over Bluetooth (particularly to an Android device .. I can't comment on iOS but I assume it is the same way), the mobile device volume is synced to the speaker's volume intervals. So even if your phone normally (without the speaker connected) allows you to adjust volume in fine increments (like 1%, 2% 3% ... etc), once the speaker is connected, your phone volume is locked to the speaker intervals (10%, 20%, 30% ... etc).If you want to listen to your speaker at quiet volumes, you may find that you're stuck choosing between 20% (too quiet) and 30% (too loud) and it is impossible to find a comfortable listening volume. I like to keep my volume low at night as to not disturb others. On the Tribit, I can't set it loud enough that I can hear it, but quiet enough that it isn't disturbing late at night.If this is an issue for you, your mobile device may have a workaround. On Android, you can enable Developer Mode (search online to find out how) and then search for a setting called ""Disable Absolute Volume"" and turn that on. That should give you fine-grained control and not force sync the device volume with the Tribit speaker volume.That will only work IF you use your mobile device to change the volume. It won't fix the poor volume stepping if you use the speaker's physical volume buttons. That is a flaw of the speaker itself.More volume steps (like 5% increments instead of 10%, for example) would have been an improvement for this product.If you don't care about low volume listening then this review isn't for you, and the speaker is absolutely worth a purchase :)","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2022",AHCPX5Y4FNNMLXH6GA4KWCHCCMXA,1,17,Color: Black
ROFLZDIFNIUJS,B07MQWG3PR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Competitive, but not the miracle speaker others seem to think it is.",A Guy,4,"This thing is right about what it needs to be. For the price, it's solidly average. What I find lacking is the treble. Everything else is good (but not outstanding).So no, I do not agree with the numerous reviews claiming this is the best speaker for the money. It's definitely competitive, but it's not notably better than similar speakers. That said, I wouldn't talk someone out of buying it for any reason. It's a good option.As of my writing of this review, this speaker is not compatible with Tribit's app, so no EQ adjustments. Wording in the app seems to imply that this functionality MAY be implemented for this (and other) speakers in the future, but I wouldn't count on it. It's a shame, because an in-built EQ could conceivably bring it to a point where I'm actually very pleased with the speaker. But as is, it's just okay.I've had a ton of bluetooth speakers. It's an unexpected hobby of mine. One thing I'd advise someone to keep in mind is that a lot of these speakers have tons of reviews overhyping their performance. None of these are miracle speakers. They can be great, but don't expect any of them to blow you away.Also, you pay extra for Bose, JBL, B&O etc., but even though these more affordable brands can impress, they never quite reach the level of those more expensive speakers. I'd say the best of these more affordable options get to about 80% of the best of the big-name brands (of course, not all models are created equal). If you were to ask me what the sweet-spot for portable bluetooth speaker was, I'd point you to the Bose Soundlink Flex. Bose really knocked it out of the park with that one especially. Don't bother spending any more than that for a portable bluetooth speaker (if you're looking for a behemoth that's technically portable but inconvenient to lug around, the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom is my current favorite, though I'd love to try the cult-classic Aiwa Exos-9 someday).","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2023",AHJTPV4IWJ5JDQX7L2FGES5VQ7UA,1,9,Color: Black

All 3 had a deal, both Tribits had a coupon and the M6 was on a lightning deal.MaxSound Plus is far superior to the XSound Go, now the MaxSound Plus is almost twice the price. But it feels only slightly heavier than the Go, and only slightly larger. If you need the speaker to be smaller I'd recommend looking into the very small options out there. The bass boost and audiobook options on the MaxSound Plus make the sound quality shine compared to the XSound Go.Eduplink M6 is a 360° speaker so comparing to Tribits Stormbox ($100+) would be better but the M6 is priced around XSound Go. The sound isn't as clear as the Tribit MaxSound Plus. The bass also doesn't compare to MaxSound Plus which has bass boost capabilities. The M6 is far lighter than either of the Tribit speakers by far. It feels half the weight of the MaxSound. But it is slightly bigger than the MaxSound.-XSound Go is the smallest of these 3 speakers.-MaxSound Plus is the loudest-MaxSound Plus has the most clarity-M6 will float-M6 is 360° so it sounds the same on every side-M6 has RGB lighting effects ""party lights""-M6 arrived with a cosmetic defect-All 3 have a cover for the charge port, USB-C-Tribit cover is easier to open, better design-All 3 have auxiliary port-All 3 say 20+ hours of battery life. It took me 3 days to drain the MaxSound Plus.I'm leaning towards keeping the Eduplink M6 because I need a beach speaker. The XSound Go doesn't stand a chance in this race. The real comparison is between M6 and MaxSound Plus.Both are plenty loud enough, MaxSound Plus has better clarity and much better bass. The M6 feels half the weight, the woven material on the M6 and silicone ends make me think it will do better keeping the sand out. The front of the MaxSound Plus has holes and if the speaker is knocked in the sand I fear it may get sand on the drivers. The M6 was almost half the price. The M6 feels like you could throw it and withstand damage better, pure speculation.If this speaker was lighter it would be my new beach speaker. I am keeping the M6 as I already have to carry a beach tent, towels, sand castle toys, & a toddler. The weight played the deciding factor for me.","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2022",AF6C2GUI6UUB3VMX4U2XYAXSS3NQ,1,3,Color: Black
R21TTA05LJ4D70,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Pure quality sound,Htet,5,"I have fallen in love with Tribit since their Tribit Xfree Tune headphone which amazed me with how a budget bluetooth headphone can perform. Then, I have bought quietplus 72, xsound go and stormbox micro, each of which showed very good offerings.I was impressed with stormbox micro, in particular, by its size-defying bass and when I planned to buy a little bigger speaker, maxsound plus was the first one I thought. I did a lot of research before buying it since there are a lot of new speakers out there, earfun uboom l, soundcore boost and newer motion 300 for eg.I've seen some reviews said that the maxsound plus is a neutral sounding speaker and the bass is not that impressive, etc. I am not an audiophile and I guess I'd prefer a fun, energetic sound than neutral sound signature. Yet, I still gave it a shot and it really impressed me. It produces a good balanced sound yet with enough thump which was lacking in smaller xsound go. While the micro has superb bass amidst it's size, maxsound plus outshines it in clarity and sound stage which I really expected.It's been out there for a while and it won't excite you with fancy design and features like newer competitors. Yet it does a great job regards to sound which still holds its reputation even in comparison with newer speakers unless bass is the only thing you're looking for in a speaker or you are comparing it with larger and heavier speakers like jbl charge 5 or motion 600.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023",AFOM3YLFJEJMWEDDCVKWZJBW4YKQ,1,0,Color: Black
R2PFM87FN7CVU5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Speaker for Price,Stygimoloch,5,"I purchased this to replace an older speaker I bought about a decade ago (not same company or anything). After searching and some light research I figured I'd give this company's Maxsound Plus a try.First impressions were packaging. The box it comes in is quite nice and it is packaged in the box very well and professional looking. Easy, simple Bluetooth connecting.I did some sound checks with different genres and was quite impressed with the quality coming out. One of the best things I noticed is how clear audio is and it scales fantastic with volume with no distortions. With and without the extra bass feature.Audio usually always sounds better with the extra bass feature on, giving a much better range of the audio of what you are playing. As others have said, depending on your environment, is how well you can really get out of the extra feature.Depending on what I played, sometimes something might be too bass-y and I found it better with it off, which is very simple by just hitting the button on top. Easy on and off. I also have used this for listening to podcasts and radio programs and found it's better with the bass off as it gives better vocal clarity. Mind that the speaker does do a good job without bass feature on, you still get a nice spectrum of the notes.After some testing with full charges, I was able to get about 8-9 hrs of use with bass feature on, and about 16-18 hours with bass off. That was with constant use with it on, at what I guess would be about 30%-50% volume. With intermittent use, with bass on and off randomly to suit my tastes, the speaker can go quite a long time before needing a charge. It probably does hit close to 20 hours with intermittent use.Last few notes; I never had a problem with going out of range and probably never hit close to its stated range. I have gotten the speaker wet, not soaked, and it holds up very well with no changes in audio and no hiccups.This speaker does a great job of directing sound, so if you need or want a speaker that you can put in a corner of a room, or want to have a specific spot in an area to 'throw' the music only in one area, this is great for that. If you want to put this in the middle of a room on say a table and want the whole room with sound, the other Tribit speaker is probably best for you.Pros-Great clear sound-No distortions through volume changes and can get quite loud-Extra bass feature is nice and does add a nice punch to your music, but isn't required to hear great sound.-Great range from audio source for the size-Great waterproofing-Nice compact design you can carry easily-Throws the audio in one direction very wellCons-Battery life can be quite well, but may not be the length you are looking for between charges.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020",AGT6BIEDHUUERLVMTG7S4NQABJCQ,1,9,Color: Black
R1EOQCVBTLRPPW,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I think best in its class,ErieEddie,5,"So far so good. First off my speaker is the anti-lemon. I’m not experiencing any of the issues mentioned in the negative reviews. Seems Tribit, like many others and perhaps most manufacturers have quality control issues especially since the pandemic began. So if you indeed received a problematic speaker perhaps a Tribit will work with you to make things right. I hear they have excellent customer service. Reminds me of the “panel lottery” with TVs. Also with electronics often the issue is due to user error(ignorance) so check out your unit carefully. I’ve yet to have any issue w/ Tribit products and I have several speakers and a pair of headphones. On to this speaker specifically. I’m thrilled . This is upgraded over the one I bought a couple years ago. This has USB-C and seems to charge faster than the old micro-USB version. It also adds an AudioBook mode to its BassBoost button. I gave that old 1 away so I can’t do a side by side comparison yet I loved that too and I know it’s still in use. Seems to me this upgraded version has a tad more clarity. Bass seems the same which is fairly thick and deep without overwhelming the mids and highs. Tribit to my ears has a smooth tube-like sound quality, subtle but present. Keep in mind the bass boost is off when the light is off, on when white but the audio-book mode is on when green and that muffles the sound, much quieter at least for music. I’ll probably never use that mode. This has well balanced high-end sound quality at least w/ my unit. Loud and clean. I own and have heard many other BT speakers. I’ve purchased Anker Soundcore, Doss, Oontz, Marshall, Fender, GGMM, JBL, etc and heard many more. This Tribit is the sound quality champ at $60 or less easily in my experience. Like I said my unit is the anti-lemon, works as intended. Uncertain about battery life yet I’ve been listening all day starting w/ a full charge and still going strong. Build quality is solid, waterproof and easy to grip although it is heavy for its size. I listen to Amazon Music Unlimited HD, so I’m streaming hi-res sources. Even in BT mode I’m hearing CD quality sound which helps bring out the potential of the speaker. Using the Aux line in would give me true hi-res(above CD sound). I refuse to listen to crappy MP3 level sound which most people use so my review is based on a high quality sound source to be fair.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2021",AHAMTKSKGBUHNENM5ZTXAIVX2RPQ,1,2,Color: Black

R125Y9X5FLH8ZW,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars I think I like this more than the MaxBoom,Craig S.,5,"First let me say I only recently decided to get Bluetooth speakers. I didn't want to spend a small fortune for them either. Nor did I want to buy a dozen different speakers to find one I would be satisfied with. I watched many reviews on YouTube for budget Bluetooth speakers. JimsReviewRoom and clavinetjunkie are both excellent review sites, and there are some other good ones too. No one seemed to have anything bad to say about Tribit. So I first bought the MaxBoom. I think it's a great speaker. Great sound, just enough volume for me, and well built. Then when the price dropped on the MaxSound, I decided to also purchase this one. Well I think I may like the MaxSound more than the MaxBoom. While the MaxBoom has a little more bass, I think the MaxSound has ""punchier"" bass and the mids and highs are incredibly detailed. It may be because the MaxSound fires directly out the front and the MaxBoom out the sides. The mids and highs just sound cleaner and crisper on the MaxSound. Since you can't connect a MaxSound and a MaxBoom together thru a Bluetooth connection, only a 2 MaxBooms can connect to each other, I decided to combine them both by using them wired to my phone at the same time. I purchased the necessary quality splitter and wires and connected it to a FiiO A3 headphone amplifier to drive a little more ""juice"" to the speakers. WOW it worked better than I expected. With the deeper bass of the MaxBoom added to the punch and crisper highs of the MaxSound, it made a great combination. I set the volume at 100% on my phone and the speakers (you can set each speaker to whatever volume you want using the speakers volume control), and just used the volume control on the FiiO A3. The FiiO A3 has a volume dial from 0(off) thru 9, a high/low gain switch, and a bass boost switch. You need to use the high gain setting. Using the bass boost on the amplifier depends on the volume and what your personal preference is. Setting the volume from 1-3 is mostly useless. 3-4 is a nice low volume with rich sound with the bass boost turned on on the amp (you can still hear someone talking normal). At 4.5-5 things really start to come to life. This is what I would consider a normal listening level. At 5.5-6 they are starting to get loud. 6.5-7.5 they are very loud, but they still sound excellent. 8 is the highest I set it and probably will never go that high again, even outside. Whether I use these individually connected thru a Bluetooth connection, which works very well, or wired to my phone individually or together, I like both of these speakers very much. But I just like the more balanced sound of the MaxSound with those crisp, detailed highs. Though I'm not at all disappointed with either. Just remember where you place the speaker in your room can make a huge difference on how it sounds. Not just these speakers, all speakers. I think both are well made and Tribit has great customer service. Which was extremely important to me.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2019",AEN5K23QP64LF7Y5GNEPAUVFFWFA,1,2,Color: Black
R3DPDRBL6DZPNX,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound in a tiny package,Dani Kittens,5,"I work in a small urgent care medical lab and we currently only have a radio and the local stations are terrible. I decided to get a Bluetooth speaker so we can all have a turn at aux and not have to listen to ads, etc.When I opened the Amazon box I thought there's no way this thing will compete with the instruments in the lab, I'll have to keep it for the bathroom or something. When I opened the actual product box I didn't think it would even be good in the bathroom. Boy was I wrong.Listen, I'm a sound snob. I own the Sony WF-1000XM4 Bluetooth ear buds which are the best on the market. I own high end powered bookshelf speakers. Etc. This little thing is amazing. I cannot get over how good it sounds. I mean is it as great as a high end audio system? No. But for something I could shove in the pocket of my scrubs to carry back and forth to work if I had to, it's absolutely phenomenal.The volume is going to have no issue being heard over our big hematology analyzer, 2 centrifuges, and a bunch of other smaller analyzers. With the extra bass on it puts out respectable bass on all the songs I tried from Brubeck's Take Five to Nine Inch Nail's Discipline. The sound is clear and pretty detailed. There's not much distortion at high volume. There's a little hiss, but what do you want? Even my bookshelf speakers have that.I can't speak to battery life and I don't really care about it, this is going to stay plugged in. Pairing was a breeze. I wish they'd fix Bluetooth in general and just let everything pair infinitely. I'm not sure what difficult it will be to unpair devices. I really only plan to use my phone and have everyone make their own Spotify playlists.Anyhow. Just buy the thing. I'm going to buy two more for at home to pair together to use for watching YouTube videos while I do chores and for music in the shower, etc. Hopefully this thing has a long life ahead of it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AGV6EZKMQOJYKPHTUJFKWJ27633Q,1,17,Color: Blue

R37K1BQL21L8LP,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars One of the best under$100 BT speakers. Recommended. Lowered rating 1 star,bobj90,4,"7-31-2019Lowered rating by 1 star due to the speaker shutting off for no reason after about 1.5-2 hours.Not that big of a deal but I was in the dentist chair and use classical music as my focus sound to reduce my fear of the dentist. The speaker shut off during the 3rd of 4 root canals that were being worked on. The speaker has always shut off after about the same length of time. Irritating when not in the chair, devastating when you are LOL. I know to crank the sending device full volume and control the volume with the BT speaker volume controls. The sound is very good still but that really irritated me. My go to speaker is now the Anker Soundboost. My Ankker Soundcore II died and they sent me the Soundboost free! Not quite as rich in sound of the Tribit at ALL volumes, but does sound better overall because of its full rich bass. And it is slightly louder.The tribit is till top notch and makes a great work desk speaker. The shutting off should cause no problems unless you are using as a speaker for your phone. The Anker Soundboost also works better for speaker phone use.The richness of sound and the fullness of the bass makes for a great listening experience. Calvinetjunkie turned me onto this one! I just recently bought the LG PK3 (Very good speaker), and the Anker Soundcore II speakers. Love the LG but it is very sensitive to placement. I like to suspend the speaker above and in front of where I am sitting working. Bass booms.The Anker blew me away when I FIRST heard it. It seems to have lost the deep rich bass and clean sound it had at the very first. Or, did the Tribit simply ""ruin"" my ears for listening to the SCII?Battery lasts as long as advertised which is nice to see.The speaker has what some reviewers refer to as ""gimmicky"": a bass boost button. I do not believe this speakers bass boost button is a gimmick. If you have any experience with BT speakers and compressed music, you know that the bass can be exaggerated and less bass is needed. Turn off the BB. When listening to some music at low volume, the bass can get lost. Turn on the BB.Very well built with sticky feet which prevent it from diving off ledges when you crank it up. It also tilts back on two feet which can help the sound. It does not have to fight the reflection of sound from a hard surface directly in front of the drivers when tilted back.The speaker can handle a lot of bass even at high volumes which is impressive. Above 70%-75% the bass does start to lessen to prevent distortion/farting. Starts to sound a little harsh, but there is no distortion!When I use only one BT speaker, it is now the Tribit!I own and use a pair Onyx Studio IIs; a pair of OontZ Angle 3XL Ultras; a pair of OontZ Angle 3 Ultras, LG PK 3; JBL Clip; and an Anker Soundcore II.This Tribit speaker is better than ANY Bose BT speaker under $200.

RPUQ4ESSLBHUM,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit holds its own for half the price vs Bose Micro and JBL Flip 5,R. A. Maynard,5,"For these tests I placed the speakers about 20 feet away (in my garage) and compared 3 different musical genres (Metal, Hip-Hop, and Jazz) using 2 iPhone Xr's and Apple Music on both. I played the segments of same songs, back to back, comparing what I heard. Both phones were set up identically - so only the speakers were different. Here is what I observed:Tribit MaxSound Plus vs Bose Soundlink Micro: The speakers sounded a little different from each other, but both sounded very good. It was hard to define the difference, and I could not say if I preferred one over the other - they were different, but good. The max volume level on both seemed to be the same - the each produced the same overall volume of sound and they each sounded great at max volume. Either one could be used in my standard two car garage to ""fill"" the room with good, high quality sounding music. Neither of the speakers sounded tiny or cheap. The Bose Micro is much smaller overall, and includes the nifty strap that can be used to attach the speaker to things like bike handlebars, etc. But, the Bose also needs to be leaned against something or laid on it's back (with the sound being directed toward the sky) when not using the strap to strap to something.Tribit MaxSound Plus vs the JBL Flip 5: These two speakers are almost identical in size and in ""feel"". The flip 5 has an overall more ""round"" tubular shape without an obvious front, whereas the Tribit has a more traditional shape and front side. Doing the same test as above, I had almost the same results. However, in this case - the JBL was notably louder at the max volume. Not a lot louder - but definitely noticeably louder. However - at half the price, I'd choose the Tribit, for any scenario. Like the JBL (and Bose) the Tribit is basically water proof and sand proof and seems very well made. The tribit also boasts a 20 hour battery and 100 foot Bluetooth radius (although I have not verified these, it seems pretty accurate).All things considered, I think the Tribit is easily the most bang for the buck, although the Bose Micro is much smaller and has a nifty strap that can be used to strap to certain things (like bike handle bars) and the JBL is a little louder at max volume. All three speakers sound great, albeit different from one another. All three are plenty loud and ""full"" enough for an average 2 car garage or any room in a home. All are plenty adequate for small outdoor gatherings as well - although maybe not for a large parties.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2020",AHERHE2YV464S5PCUGX2SB5EZJIA,1,1,Color: Black
R3MLGSY10URWZY,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasantly Surprised!,Miya,5,"So, I live in a condo on the ground floor, and have an older upstairs neighbor who claims to ""lose sleep"" over *any* sounds coming from my unit - once, he even went so far to gift me with some ancient over-the-ear headphones to listen to my TV (complete with a 4' cord and a Radio Shack-era connection jack). Not only do I listen to terrible 90s industrial music, I like it somewhat loud... the electronic shrieking and hammering and horror movie sampling, God, I love it. I was looking for a speaker that I could connect to my phone via Bluetooth that would have decent sound quality, but not evoke the wrath of the grumpy homie upstairs. After doing some comparisons, and also taking into consideration that I was going to use my ex-boyfriend's $50 gift card, this Tribit MaxSound seemed to get pretty solid reviews, so I cackled, ""If you're going to leave me from a heroin-addicted prostitute, well, I'M going to get a speaker!"" and placed the order. The speaker was nicely packaged and included the USB charging cable and an AUX cable, and I was impressed at the weight of the unit itself. I have two maniacal demons living in my house that pretend to be cats, and they like to knock stuff over (while looking deep into the depths of my soul) when I'm trying to relax. I charged it up for about an hour and gave it a go with Front 242's ""Headhunter,"" the song I've christened every new audio device I've had since 1989. This song is not light on bass, and even on ""vanilla"" (normal) mode, it sounded pretty good at 50% volume. I selected the Bass EQ setting and while I wouldn't say it was thumpin', it was impressively rich for such a small unit. I eventually turned things up to 100% volume, and wow, it filled my 15'x12' great room surprisingly well, with no distortion. It's loud enough on its own, but now I'm hoping my neighbor will move (like he's threatened to do for the last 10 years) and I can get a second unit to experience the true stereo sound.

R3RDMJNTDCPA4A,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect - Very Nice Speaker,Mikel1976,4,"I really like this speaker and want to give it 5 stars. Maybe I'll change it to 5 stars (originally I had it at 4). If I could pick 4 1/2 stars I would. I love everything about the speaker except for having to push the play button 2 times to skip next and 3 times to skip back. Most of the time it does work, but sometimes I end up pausing the song or going forward when I want to go back. The sound is really good. This Tribit MaxSound Plus is louder, clearer, has more bass and is better sounding than my Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, which is a good thing because it's bigger and cost $20 more. I recently purchased this speaker (the Tribit), the oontz Angle 3 Ultra and the Anker SoundCore2. I tested and compared all 3 speakers in different environments. My end goal was to have a great shower speaker that I rarely have to charge. The Soundcore2 was great, but the Oontz was better for clarity and overall sound. The Soundcore2 really did sound good, but I decided in the end that it had a piercing quality that my ears found a little uncomfortable at high volume. As for the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, I don't like that the Oontz controls are on the end instead of the top. I found I really have to turn the speaker and look at it to switch songs, which is annoying, however, I also found that if I keep the speaker firing away from me with easy access to the side controls, it actually sounds just as good or better and I can see the controls, which include seek forward and seek back. In the end, I think the Oontz will end up being my shower speaker due to the controls. The Tribit Wins for best sound, especially in the shower. It just sounds wonderful and has more volume than I will ever use in the shower. If I have any complaint on sound, I feel it's missing some midrange. I've noticed only a few times that I feel I'm missing some of the middle tones in some songs, but then maybe I'm over analyzing. Overall, I just love the speaker and wish I had more opportunities to use it. It sounds better in any environment than the others, but because I skip songs a lot and replay them a lot and it doesn't have dedicated buttons to do this, I can't see using it as my everyday speaker. Comparing it to the Oontz and the Anker is really not fair, because it's just a different class really. It's definitely worth the extra $20. I had originally planned on keeping only one speaker, but I can't bring myself to return this. If you want something that really thumps with good bass and good highs and you don't mind the controls, then I think this is a Great choice and a great value.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2019",AEP5DCNVC3SVDHKD5GX6OFATQGHA,1,8,Color: Black

R2E9PH2NE1KNLE,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars My second blue tooth speaker, so far it's quite good!",Tom H.,5,"I got this speaker for listening to in the bedroom while exercising and out on the deck when catching some rays. My first experience with bluetooth speakers was with a teeny Altec Lansing model - roughly half the size of this and a third of the weight. It's a hefty brute! I loved being able to offload my listening from the built-in iPhone 12 speaker I first started using (which doesn't sound that bad, BTW), and wanted something that sounded a little louder and was still better sounding overall. This speaker fit the bill quite nicely. It has a bass boost feature that I have simply left on, as it provided a nice punch to bass sounds, without overwhelming the rest of the music. The battery doesn't last as long as I would like though - after about 3 hours at about 1/3 volume and with the bass boost on, it drops to approx. 50% from an initial full charge. If I had been using it for, say, a party or social gathering lasting longer than that, I could see it running out of charge too soon. So keep that in mind. Still not bad, since I don't have such gatherings,, but it has led me to charge it after every use basically, which is a bit annoying. Given the quality of the sound and seeming good construction quality, overall I'm still quite satisfied. I bought the carrying case for this at the same time as well, which was also quite good and recommended.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AEMH3VIUIGJ363MNQUQAF734MMXA,1,3,Color: Black

There are 3 built-in EQ options but none of them give a balanced sound like the go's have. Yes, it has more bass and will play louder for sure, but the sound quality/balance isn't as good.Around $50, I think this is just an ok speaker, unlike the go's which are great for their price point.If you mostly listen on the high side of volume, it might be ok for you.

This should work pretty well, though it won't be as loud as some of my coworkers job-site radios. Of course, I would like it to be louder, but I can't take a star away for unmet/unrealistic expectations.The sound quality is outstanding and has a nice even flat-ish EQ to it. That's important to me as a musician and someone who has done recording/mixing before. I'll probably not use the bass boost that often listening to music, though maybe I will while watching movies for a bigger sound.Compared to the X Sound Go, the Plus is only marginally louder, but it is much more full sounding even without the bass boost turned on. In the world of sound/power, it takes 10x the wattage to get a 3db gain in volume (a perceived doubling of the volume), so going from 12 watts in the X Sound Go to 24 watts in the Plus isn't going to yield much more volume. If you're familiar with guitar, I would say it is the difference between playing through a Fender Princeton and a Deluxe Reverb. Not much louder, just bigger sounding.Overall I'm impressed with the sound, and it can't be touched for the price!!","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2023",AFJJRTRQKN5PTHRY3JYJHJKST5YA,1,14,Color: Black

Videos won’t route audio half the time, bluetooth connection will override AUX-in even in silence, and the only way to know that you’re really changing the volume is with the buttons on the speaker. They control your device volume but sometimes using your device as a media remote will fail for volume control. The EQ modes are fun, Battery life seems good and I appreciate the USBC port! I also like that this speaker is stereo even though it’s on the more compact side. Not the best L/R definition since the drivers are fairly close together but it beats mono for me generally!

RS9L1VD50BFBD,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Earned my Respect,Carolyn Wilburn,5,"I rarely rate purchased items of any kind, but the quality of the Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker and Tribit's customer service have earned my respect, my time, and five stars. For those of you looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that holds its charge at least all night long, can be easily packed for travel, and sounds just fine for its size, the Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker should at least be a finalist in your smaller Bluetooth speaker selection process. Before purchasing my Tribit, I had a larger Bluetooth speaker of a different brand that sounds splendid, but I needed a smaller one for travel. The Tribit MaxSound Plus has proven to be a perfect fit, solidly build, and of decent weight--it is not a cheap piece of junk, but interestingly engineered with both hardware and software to produce good sound. I purchased my first Tribit MaxSound Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker, which worked flawlessly, more than a year ago, then gave it to my daughter who travels more than I. I replaced it with a second Tribit MaxSound Plus. Unfortunately, that speaker was faulty. I arranged with customer service to have it replaced. The replacement speaker arrived, but it too would not work, at least at first. Customer service and I speculated that the problem was the charging wire, and sent me a new one. That did not immediately solve the problem. Thinking the speaker was frozen, like a PC will freeze occasionally, I let the speaker completely drain of power, then I completely recharged it. That draining/charging process did reset the speaker and it now works fine. For you future Tribit owners, please be aware that this resolution is not in Tribit's instruction manual. Reset instructions there ask you to press the up and down volume buttons simultaneously, which for my purposes did nothing. A final comment to share concerns the charging wire. Be sure to color code it so you will know which way is up when you plug it into the speaker. Otherwise, it is easy to mistakenly try to put it in upside down; do that enough and you will shorten the life of your charging wire or damage the speaker part the charging wire fits onto. I extend my congratulations to Tribit's engineers and to Tribit's customer service. Your product sounds good, you were easy to contact, and you worked with me to resolve my issues. The end result is blissful sound--good things take time but the best ones also sound good.","Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2020",AGPLOEXZGBTQUW5UO3RSO5YPPUNA,1,0,Color: Black

R3MJ6N19592NZT,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Sound, Rivals Bigger Speakers",Amazon Customer,5,"Blown away by the sound quality of the Tribit Maxsound. Deep resonant bass, full mids and clear highs, very well integrated, sounding more like a home hi fi system than a portable speaker. Battery life is so far good, on my second day of playing it for hours, still at 50%. I've had the less powerful predecessor, the X Sound Go, and while that one was excellent, this one has even more clarity and much more powerful bass, with an added bass radiator in the back. The X Bass mode sounds best, deep and full, but nice to have the option to have less bass in situations where someone nearby might be disturbed, or it's not required eg. light bedtime music, classical, ambient. Phenomenal speaker, can't say enough about the sound quality. I have other larger speakers and this one makes as much or more bass. Has a premium feel, very solid build and easy on the eyes. Haven't tested the IPX7 rating but videos on YouTube show this speaker playing under water no problem. At this price you can't go wrong. Only thing I would change, would be nice if the speaker could be paired in stereo then I'd buy another one. You still could pair them with two Aux cords and a splitter. Wouldn't be left right stereo but would still sound good. Stereo and sound separation is excellent. The Tribit sounds much bigger than it is. Google incorrectly says this speaker doesn't have an aux input, it does. Bluetooth pairing is fast, good solid connection and range. There's really nothing else this size, at this price, that sounds this good. Even sounds better than speakers twice the size and price. It's a joy to listen to this speaker, such a smooth, rich and well balanced sound. Compared to new Bugani Shock, upgraded version of the M83, the Tribit is more clear, and has deeper bass at low volume. The sound quality is superb. Fantastic speaker. Sounds better than comparable JBL speakers as well, even the larger ones. Other speakers sound either tinny or muffled compared to the Tribit. Buy it now and be happy.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AGXAZR2ELUNBJ7FF5XDDEPFCQSKA,1,4,Color: Black
RB8D8IPW344QA,B07MQWG3PR,2.0 out of 5 stars Pick your poison: Muddy highs or anemic bass,J S,2,"I bought this after my absolute satisfaction with Tribit's Stormbox vertically-standing speaker, which has it all: Great highs, deep bass when you turn on the bass boost, and generally solid battery lift.That product no longer available to me, I picked up this ThunderBox thinking, ""Heck, it's almost got the same name, surely it's just as good, right?!""Wrong.Pairing and bluetooth range may be an ounce better on this unit, but the sound quality is an issue, and from a company that usually hits it out of the park for me, a self-admitted audio snob.Without bass boost on, the mids and highs sound good, normal, what you'd expect. The bass response, however, to say it was ""lackluster"" would be kind, and also incorrect. The only word to really describe it is ""anemic"". Mind you, the StormBox isn't great without bass boost, but this ... this ThunderBox is bad.Something weird with bass boost on, though ... the highs get muddy and dull. Almost like putting bass boost on activates a cap/filter that chops off everyhing above 8,000-10,000 Hz or something. Like, all brightness from the highs disappears, and it drags the sound down.I will say, it's great in the typical Tribit ways: Good battery life. Rock-solid bluetooth connectivity with all devices, computer and smartphone. Nice appearance. Very portable. It's just the sound. I hate to say it, but it kinda sucks in comparison to previous Tribit headphones and other bluetooth speakers from their past, like the StormBox.So my advice? If you're buying this to replace your tired StormBox, DON'T. You'll be disappointed. I'd wait at least another product generation to see if they can iron out the wrinkles in that one. This speaker is ultimately going into our camping box, to be used in a pinch, when there's no other option.I'm disappointed with Tribit on this one.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2024",AGBPNJL46RD5XNLJP75UGPR4D4GQ,1,0,Not Provided
R12MEWZ687A3V1,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Reliable, with loud, clear sound",Jen H (and sometimes Mr H :-)),5,"Radio reception in our area is abysmal, so I always listen to the radio via my computer. I am at home during the day and listen to talk radio (NPOR, the BBC) and audiobooks all day long, carrying the speaker around with me the speaker around with me. I've gone through a number of speakers - so,me good, some bad. Before this one, I had a Deck speaker that I also liked, and which was slightly more compact, but that is no longer being produced. I really like the Tribit speaker. I find the sound really clear and the range very good indeed. I rarely listen to music, so I can't really testify as to what extent it will satisfy those who are very discriminating concerning music output, but my spouse, who does listen to music, hasn't yet complained. We have a 2,000 sq ft fixer-upper home and the Tribit connection works throughout the house. (Unlike the blinkin cellphones!) It does lose the connection if I take it down the garden to the dustbins, but so have all my previous speakers, and I normally use my refurbished ""professional"" Logitech headphones outside anyway, in order not to be a public nuisance! (I prefer not to use headphones all the time.) The Tribit It comes with a short, cord-like wrist strap, but I've attached a brightly colo(u)red lanyard to it, to make it easier to grab and also locate if I go out and forget where I left it.. :-) If the computer powers down, the speaker turns itself off fairly quickly to conserve battery power and since I invariably leave the house in a mad rush, I find this a very helpful feature, too.In my experience, if you're going to use a Bluetooth speaker regularly, it's better not to opt for the cheapest ones. Not only because the sound quality will usually be poorer, but also because in normal use, rather than in the lab, the range is rarely as good as the maximum range claimed, and if, like me, you're clumsy and drop them, it tends to get worse! Although the Tribit handbook recommends NOT dropping it (surprise, surprise!) mine has survived several such episodes. Though I wish, nonetheless, that it came with a protective case, or offered one as an optional extra.The Tribit speaker was a gift from my husband, who knows more about these things. But I am really happy with it and am very glad he selected this one!","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2019",AGFT7YIPZHYJ4IULGIKONJJJCUPQ,1,0,Color: Black
R12EYF3QHE85WR,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Terrific sound and brief speaker comparison,scjr,5,"I own an original XSound Go and two XBoom’s, which I can daisy chain. I’ve been impressed with every speaker Tribit has released up until this point and this new MaxSound Plus is no exception.The Plus has a well balanced, neutral and pleasing sound. It’s the improved big brother of the Go. The Plus is slightly larger in size and definitely heavier. When you hold both in your hands, you can definitely feel the difference in weight. I think the Go would be a better option portability wise. The Plus has rugged hard rubber exterior. Build quality is excellent.The MaxSound gets plenty loud enough, but the most important point to mention—the music is well balanced. No scratchy treble or booming notes that are out of place in the sound signature. Just a well rounded sound. I think it’s important to note: Make sure you turn on the XBass feature, as this feature enhances the overall sound and adds a fuller note, especially at lower levels. You can listen to this speaker for hours without being fatigued.I was introduced to the Tribit brand by clavinetjunkie’s YouTube channel. Oluv’s channel is great, because he focuses on quality of sound—not just how loud a speaker gets. Overall loudness, for the most part, doesn’t always equal great sound. I recommend you check out his channel. It will definitely help in your search for speakers.My short take on each Tribit speaker I own:XSound Go:Still sounds great.Best for portability.Lowest price point.MaxSound Plus:Sounds the best.Improved larger version of Go.Mid price point.XBoom:Sounds great. 360 sound.Ability to daisy chain two speakers.Highest price point.Just choose one of the speakers that matches your price point or listening environment. This MaxSound and their other speakers are an excellent value to price. There isn’t a compelling reason to purchase an overpriced name brand, with inferior sound quality.I posted several pictures of the MaxSound and my other Tribit speakers for size comparison. You can see the size difference between the Go and the Plus. I purchased all of these speakers, except for one of the XBoom’s I won in a contest. My personal experience with the Tribit brand has been positive. This MaxSound Plus is definitely a keeper.EDIT: This is just a heads up for anyone suffering random shutdowns with their MaxSound Plus. I had this issue and Tribit provided me with a firmware that corrected the issue. Great support from Tribit. Just email Tribit and they will send you the firmware.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2019",AGOHYHPEY4D6UKYJB6KFVORX5MXA,1,17,Color: Black

R2EY3BFRSFK7H8,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent choice,SomeRandomChad,5,"This thing is great. I don't like poor sounding tunes, they won't be tolerated in my presence. This speaker delivers.Sound - this speaker has full and dynamic range. Reaches good highs and deep enough lows. I was initially confused by the bass button - of course I want the bass! - but while using it and responsibly talking with some friends from a distance, I found it was helpful to turn just the bass down. I don't usually do this, but it's actually a nice feature.Volume - My last blutooth speaker blew the woofer on 4th of July while getting our freedom on. This speaker is easily 4x as loud (and 3x the price). At near max volume, it sounds great too. It's easily loud enough to fill a backyard and be heard with kids screaming. It's easily too loud for anywhere indoors unless you're getting wild. At low volume, the bass can be a little more loud than it needs to be (muddy) so you might push the button to turn the bass down.Range - Seems to be pretty good. I've only had my phone about 20ft from it and it didn't skip a beat.Battery - It'll blast the beats for at least 8 hours (that's about the longest I've had it running). I've used it about 15 times for 30 minutes each on a single charge (at low volume). I haven't yet pushed it hard enough to kill the battery. So i'd say it's pretty good.Size - About the size of a 16oz can of delicious brewskie. Twice the weight. I still use a much smaller (wallet sized) speaker for more personal use such as when hiking/mtn biking. This big boi goes to the pool with us, on the back patio, and in the garage all the time.Bonus - I chose this based on some online reviews AND that it's directional - meaning the speakers all face one direction. This means I can focus music to where i want it playing. For me, this was important. If you want omnidirectional music, this doesn't exactly do that.- Cheers","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020",AHJ6YRAQNQN74LNSQAZM5SIGJNGA,1,1,Color: Black
R1X24MR50HMXG5,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic travel speaker at great value,Godwin,5,"I have gone through several portable speakers in my quest to find a great all purpose travel speaker that I can take on my Business or leisure trips. The 2 most recent ones are the Bose Mini Soundlink and the Vifa Helsinki.Bose soundlink mini is ok for music, but terrible for spoken word/podcast because of its boomy sound. It’s almost unusable.The Vifa Helsinki is one of the best portable Bluetooth speaker, with very detailed sound. At home it is able to match with my homepods, home theatre speakers and studio monitors when I am playing music via airplay. (Vifa Helsinki connected via Aux to an Airport Express which can receive Airplay 2).However, it is too big to travel with, And rather heavy. It greatly increases my carry on luggage weight.I came across this brand on the YouTube channel Oluv’s Gadgets. It provides detailed comparisons and reviews of all kinds of Bluetooth/portable speakers. The Tribit Maxsound Plus compared rather favourably to other more well known more expensive brands. For $50 it was a no brainer to try.I am very satisfied with this speaker. It’s a small travel speaker. And despite its diminutive size, it produces respectable clarity and bass. If anyone is going to use this as their primary speaker, please don’t. Get something bigger like the Vifa Helsinki. For podcasts and generally listening to music, this speaker produces very pleasing sound.For $50 (or even $60) this is extremely good value, at a great size as it fits nicely in even a small backpack.As a travel speaker, I have absolutely no complaints. It has very good highs, mids and bass. Placing it near a wall or a corner enhances the sound quite a bit.They claim water resistance so I use it in the bathroom as well. Definite plus for outdoor use.The battery life is great, I have not had to worry about charge but I do plug it in every 3-4 days after listening to it for a couple of hours everyday.And it charges via USB which is great, the Vifa needs a bulky power adapter.I would have never paid attention to this brand were it not for the review and comparison I watched on YouTube. I usually only buy relatively high end speakers (the Helsinki cost me $400) and by default I would dismiss any sub $100 speaker. But I gave this a shot and am very pleased.As small travel speakers, I highly recommend this.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2019",AHA5RITWO32E3EZE2FBXD2EWZSGA,1,17,Color: Black

R1H7W2RZZA62EF,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Saved $100+ by not getting JBL/Bose speaker,Rick Lyon,5,"I was looking at the JBL Charge 3/4, UE Mega Boom and the Bose soundlink that were all around $125-$150. I couldn't make up my mind on sound quality among those 3 and I was trying to justify the price for several times a month that I would need to use the speaker. I decided to keep researching and came across this never-heard-of unit which Amazon is notorious for carrying. I read the reviews and for the price decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did!For less than a thrid of the cost of the models I was looking at, I am super happy with the Tribit. It comes in a simple box and not much else. Nothing fancy. However, the sound is very nice and it had some great bass for the price, size and compared to the models I was looking at. I listen to all types of music but I listen mostly to hip hop, R&B, electronica, etc that require bass to hear anything from the sound. This delivers. The bass is great, no complaints. It's not deep bass obviously, but it's not tincup sounding and produces a decent range. The mids and highs are clear. The JBL was too harsh on the high range for me, and both the Bose and UE favored the mids too much. The Tribit was well balanced. It doesn't exceed at anything, but it's not muddy either.For battery life, I haven't charged it yet. I've had it for about 2 months, used it for about 4-6 hours 3 times and then a few extra times at less than an hour or so each time. So less than 20 hours so far but I haven't charged it yet so I'm happy it seems to be lasting.So to sound just as good, if not slightly better for a 3rd of the price is a definite score. I haven't put it through all the paces and done any scientific type research on it, I just know it satisfied my love for bass, has decent sound overall and comes in at a great price.

Either they got a bad one, and that happens with every brand and you can usually get a replacement, they are just ignorant or stupid. You are not going to get better sound on something this size for $60 and probably not even for $100. As for power, if you are outside you are not going to here it very well if you are 20' away. If you are in a smaller room, sitting on a porch or patio or have it near you on a table you will have plenty of volume but don't expect it to compete with bluetooth boxes that have much larger speakers. There is plenty of bass if you have the XBass button on. I can't say exactly how many hours you get out of the battery because I usually only use it for a short while at a time but I can go quite a while before needing to charge it so I will assume the battery life is close to what they say it is.

R3FI5D98JUM4VB,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound However Needs Improvement,Joanne,3,"I received this speaker literally 6 hours ago. This small speaker (with the xbass on) packed a real punch for its small size. In addition, the battery seemed to last a while considering how I used it for about 4 hours straight and the battery didn’t drop that much. I used this speaker to sit on the sink counter and listen to music while I showered. I noticed that the volume was pretty loud despite my phone being 30-40% volume which is great! When I got out of the shower I switched the speaker back into my computer and it was still wonderful! However after I paused my music I realized that there was a static noise coming from the speaker when the music stop. It would then play a high pitch noise and then stop playing noise entirely. Note that this speaker was is not damaged, I didn’t drop it or get it wet. So I thought maybe it was the Bluetooth connection. I haven’t figured out the static issue of this speaker, but I noticed that the USB-C charging port is loose and makes a clicking noise when wiggled.TL;DRPros:- Amazing bass! With the xbass on, the bass was super good (granted it doesn’t sound that full, but the for the size of the speaker it’s super good!)- Loud volume. Granted speakers are supposed to be loud, but I’m surprised how loud it was given its size.- Pretty good battery life so far! Stayed at 40% for the 4 hours of use!Cons:- Became staticky after 4 hours of usage. It could be an issue with my Bluetooth, but I’m not entirely sure. I connected it to my iPhone and it was still staticky.- The USB-C port moves a lot. Granted it still charges, but I’m afraid that the port will wear down quickly.Final thoughts:I will sleep on this, and let the speaker charge up some more and hope that it somehow fixes itself in the morning.Update:Customer support is phenomenal! I sent a ticket in at around 1am and received an email back at 1:20am. That response time is incredible (they’re stationed in Germany so it was around 8am for them)! I told them about the static noise and they told me ways to fix the problem and offered a $7 refund (I bought this without the $6 coupon because it wasn’t available at that time).","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AGGE7NMHAIAIVGK2WECD4ZTWAU7Q,1,5,Color: Black

The added bass has depth, isn't boomy and doesn't overwhelm the mids and highs. The sound is nicely balanced and easy to listen to. It sounds full at both low volume and turned up. It can fill up a medium sized space. Pairing two gives you true stereo and even better sound. Now these are fairly small speakers and the bass while quite impressive will not hit you in the chest so be real about expectations. I also own a Soundcore Motion +. As a stand alone it is better than a single Tribit. But using two in stereo the sound stage is different but comparable and sometimes preferred. Two Tribits and a single Soundcore cost roughly the same. (Around $100). A single Maxsound Plus is very capable, well-built, excellent battery and at about $50 a bargain.

At lower volume it sound OK, you need to use the Bass booster to make the sound fuller. But when used outside or larger space and mid or high volume that's when this thing really excels. The dynamic range is there, but the tone, is very good. When you hear the bass (instrument) is not only the low end but you actually ear the mid bass range, that is hard to listen in any other Bluetooth speaker, the bass doesn't exist or get too boom.

I was operating on a budget, looking for something that could replace my OontZ Angle 3.I liked the OontZ, but I also really enjoy a good punchy sound from smaller speakers. The Angle 3 got impressively loud, but always lacked a substantial kick unless placed on a specific kind of surface (I found the floor tom of my drum kit works great, but try lugging that into the office).I found out about the MaxSound Plus a week or so before it became available, and with Tribit’s website giving me 30% off for signing up to get notified upon release, I thought it was a bargain.A couple hours into listening to this speaker and I can assuredly say it’s worth the money, even if you do pay full price; I would have gladly splurged $50 on this thing (with my coupon, I paid around $35).It is a small speaker, but the heft of it is satisfying. The normal mode does have a pronounced low end - nothing to make your heart thump, but it’s rock solid for a small speaker (I would say better than the Beats Pill+‘s soulless knock). Turning the XBass on is the equivalent feeling of popping your ears; it’s a rush of new frequencies you forgot you appreciated so much.The battery life seems legit, as I’ve been listening to music and podcasts at moderate levels for the last two hours, and the battery meter hasn’t visibly gone down - it came out of the box with a 60% charge.I do like that the volume is synchronized with my phone, so I don’t have to worry about what volume which device is at before playing. I live in a small apartment, and the connectivity has been flawless so far. The only thing I found strange is this speaker doesn’t take kindly to quick changes in volume - i.e. when I use the volume slider on my phone to ramp the sound up quickly, the speaker tends to stammer and lag a little bit. This is totally something I can deal with, but I’ve never heard another speaker act like this.Bottom line though, the sound is brilliant for a small speaker, and I’m looking forward to months if not years of enjoyment out of this little guy.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2019",AH2U3MPSHQKNTSGOHRQDUCOQRZOQ,1,17,Color: Black
R1C0QZPAP4I7VN,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars A Mighty Mite of a Speaker, A Real Overachiever!",Arrowsmith47,5,"This device is well made. The shell seems to be metallic and is quite heavy. The manufacturer has built it with great care. The front grille is sturdy and seems to be a composite material, it is a winner so far. This speaker is quite heavy for its size which speaks to the battery inside it. The initial charge was stated to require 4hrs with normal USB current. Stated operation on a charge is 20 hrs. The business end consists of two speakers of approx 2inches in diameter. They deliver treble an mid range sound. Between them is a woofer of about 2inches by 1 inch in a rounded horizontal format. This bass speaker has sound vents to the rear of the device. Bluetooth pairing and connection were easily accomplished. The range of this connection exceeds the distance available in my house. Walls and doors were not a problem. I tested this speaker with my test playlist on Amazon music. Loud rock, and soft classical. Soprano, and Bass singers. I have listened to a variety of Sirius channels. I do the with every set of earbuds, earphones a speaker I have bought in the last 5 years. This diminutive portable set out performs the built in speakers in my iPad, my Galaxy S10, and the good Logitech speakers I use with my computer. Indeed it performs as well as I can hear. The bass is really good, especially when you use the bass expansion or “X” button. Within the limits of my hearing, the treble and mid range are more than I expected. I am pleased with the volume, an quality of the output. The manufacturer is to be complemented on a well made and high performing portable speaker. I received this device inside 24hours, it arrived in a well fixed inner box. It includes a aux cable, and a standard USB charging cable. However both are quite short an light gauge plastic coated wire. My cat loves plastic wire insulation, so I am using 3rd party fabric cables of much heavier gauge. This is literally the only gripe I could find about this speaker. Glad I bought this one.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2019",AHWCAL3UU7RWMKLDBL6C72KKDDUA,1,12,Color: Black
R27ORTAMS5OGT0,B07MQWG3PR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the upgrade, probably",Leez,5,"While the shape of both the original speaker and this speaker is still a little unfortunate for car use, I definitely don't regret buying the original XSound or upgrading to this one after the previous one died to years of rough treatment from me. This one is much louder, and has an excellent bass boost setting.Apparently it also has an audiobook setting as well, but I have no clue how audiobooks sound on it as I don't listen to them. I definitely think Tribit is the best ""budget"" audio brand out there right now and none of their products have ever disappointed me. It is a little heavier and larger than I expected, so if you plan to carry it around casually for some reason, it might be more reasonable to go with the smaller model.Unfortunately, the bass boost setting does seem to eat battery life much faster than the regular setting, but it's still a respectable battery life all the same.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AEMXIBNLULLSWNOBL2BKTARKCONQ,1,3,Color: Black
R3546FDHU8XXNK,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars Well worth the money!,larryf1952,5,"I was looking for a bluetooth speaker to use with my phone while I worked in different parts of the house, or while doing tasks where it was not convenient to listen to my computer. This would be my first BT speaker, so I was flying sort of blind. I didn't want to spend a lot straight out of the gate, but I wanted something that sounded better than an old transistor radio. This little Tribit MaxSound Plus has hit the jackpot.I did a LOT of research and listened to a LOT of reviews. Everywhere that I went, people had good things to say about the Tribit. I ordered one, and I have been extremely satisfied with the quality of sound that comes out of this little box. Having said that, one must remember that it cannot rewrite the laws of physics. It's still a tiny box, with tiny speakers. One must not expect it to perform above its physical limitations. Within those limitations, though, it performs admirably.I set the Tribit up and paired it with my old Samsung S6. It connected in just a few seconds. I pulled up Pandora and began to listen to some smooth jazz. I was immediately struck by how the mids punched through. Snare hits and guitar riffs were up front and accurate. Vocals were crisp and clean, without any warbling or perceptible distortion. In the ""extra bass"" mode, the bass notes came through accurately and without overpowering the rest of the music. At max volume, the bass suffers a bit, but still sounds great for the size of the box. The dynamic range of this little speaker, for a price of under $50, does in itself almost defy the laws of physics.I had ordered another manufacturer's speaker at the same time that I ordered the Tribit, because it, too, had had good reviews. It did not hold a candle to the Tribit. It was AWFUL. It sounded as if the musicians were playing inside a tin can, inside a cardboard box. It's going back.If you're looking for a decent BT speaker just to have around, without breaking the bank, try the Tribit. You'll get WAY more than you spent.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2019",AFLJAID65ESVK2PC45Z567OK2QDQ,1,17,Color: Black
R2Y2RAVMCLKLUU,B07MQWG3PR,5.0 out of 5 stars How is it possible to get this sound for $50.00?,Gilly Girl,5,"I have bought several out door speakers to use at my pool. No matter what they promise; long battery life, clear sound, easy to use etc none of them have done what they promise. Blue tooth cuts in and out ,battery dies after a couple of hours , takes 10 minutes to get it to pair the list goes on and on. So I thought what the heck , I am going to buy a cheap speaker since every summer I struggle with the high dollar ones I have.Nothing is worse than a great album playing and boom your speaker dies or cuts out. So this was my choice and it is unbelievable you can get a product that sounds like this for the price. First , I am not very electronically savvy , so when I can hook up and pair a speaker in 5 minutes that is pretty remarkable my #1 reason for wanting to kiss the manufacturer of this product is ease of use - Just plug it in, charge it, pair it and boom your done. #2 the sound is amazing. Even at low level I can hear it from across the backyard and it is nice clear sound, not this cut in and out sound that I am use to. #3 The freakin battery lasted from when I turned it on at 10am until I turned it off at 7pm that night, and still had charge the next day! Therefore I am totally thrilled with my little speaker. My husband, who can find something wrong with everything , even said "" wow, that is some speaker""how much did you pay for that??So if you want a speaker for around $50.00 that sounds like one that cost $250 buy this speaker! I am going to buy another one to keep in doors.

R1L49YM1JSRYWN,B07MQWG3PR,3.0 out of 5 stars A partial step up from the Tribit Go,EmbeddedFlyer,3,"I also have the smaller Tribit Go and this plays louder and has even more bass but isn't as impressive overall given the bigger size and price. The bass in normal mode is far less than the Go and with the extended bass feature turned on it has more bass than the Go but it's a bit more boomy and less natural than the Go.If you're after louder more room filling sound this is the better choice but there are likely other bluetooth speakers in this price range that may do even better although they will probably be larger. For it's size the MaxSound is fairly impressive.The specified battery life is 20 hours versus 24 hours for the Go. In practice it depends greatly on the volume level for both. If you push the MaxSound hard you'll be lucky to get 4 hours. In real world use the Go seems to run significantly longer on a charge.Like the Go it sounds fairly good with a relatively balanced sound with some extra bass punch. I think the mids and highs on the Go sound a bit better. The MaxSound also suffers from what's known as inter-modulation distortion which is the technical way of saying the bass mucks up the mids and highs at higher volumes. This is common with single full range drivers as used here. Better designs use a ""subwoofer"" for the deeper bass to avoid the distortion but they will be larger and not as portable.But both Tribit speakers sound WAY better than most of the no-name Chinese brands with their over boosted fatiguing highs and fake boomy bass. The build quality is also excellent. Both Tribit speakers are solid, heavy, have no buzzes or rattles, and the controls work well. Both seem to connect well and have decent Bluetooth range.Both have an aux input which is nice and you don't get with many Bluetooth speakers in this price range. Both will work while charging which isn't true of some speakers. And both are supposedly rain or shower proof but I haven't tested that.I'd put either Tribit model up against anything from say Logitech even close to the same price. Logitech spends more on marketing than designing better products. I'd also put either Tribit up against most any speaker of the same size at any price.Ultimately either are small enough to throw in your backpack but the smaller cheaper Go is still my favorite portable speaker unless I really need something louder.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2020",AGY7DVH6BSZWM735FPL7UK74Y57A,1,6,Color: Black

Anyhow, after getting over my disappointment I decided to try a different brand and found this Tribit MaxSound. I ordered this and an Oontz Angle Pro, and the clarity overall plus the bass, blew the Oontz Angle Pro away. I was really impressed!If you want ONE speaker that is small, inexpensive, and sounds incredible, this is a great speaker. BUT if you were hoping to get several of them to pair together and spread around your yard or wherever for parties, etc. this will NOT WORK. When you read a dozen product descriptions it gets hard to remember which said which and I swore I could get a few more of these to link together which was my plan and once I heard how great it sounded, I was about to order more of them, but I guess that was a different brand sadly. So I will be returning this and getting 2 Oonzt Angle 3 Ultra which CAN be linked together, even though on it's own this Tribit sounds better.

R1CSCXMH6PSVQ1,B07MQWG3PR,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best but better after equalization,Simon Y,4,"Natively, it does not have the bass of Bose soundlink (Mini / Flex) even with XBass enabled. I'm too used to Bose I guess, as I love even a little bit of thump at low volumes. Online reviews gave me the impression the bass is close to Bose, but it isn't so for me. The rear base-reflex of Bose soundlink is louder, giving deeper sounds at very low volumes, especially late at night. (I listened to Soft Rock and 80s new wave) But when used with an equaliser, the Tribit gets close (helped by keeping near the corner of the room). I just need to boost the lower frequencies a little. Higher frequencies no adjustment needed. I bought 2 units to pair in stereo mode to give me a wider soundstage. Even with 2 units (after discounts), it's cheaper than one Bose. Battery-wise, doesn't come close to 20hours. More like 9-10 hours at 50% volume.Edit:1. Managed to get 17hours playback when connected via Aux cable and at low volume.2.

I got this and the X-Sound Go to see which was better, based on all the reviews I saw. It was an extremely close call! You almost don’t notice a difference. This unit won for a slightly louder overall sound, slightly deeper bass and the technicality of larger wattage. I figured I’d want that more in the end. I liked the size of the X-Sound Go much better, but this isn’t bad... just definitely bigger and heavier. The sound is pretty consistent, however I notice that at full volume, the bass fades out and you hear a lot more of the higher tones of the music. The bass sounds more like a low clap in the background. However, turning it down to about 60 percent or lower and you definitely hear a better sounding bass. I do wish that this was updated to Bluetooth 5.0 TWS and also USB-C as they’ve done with the X-Sound Go. I figured I’d be able to deal with the micro USB since I have a couple other devices that also use that still.I also purchased the Asimom 28 Watt speaker. That was also a really close contender, however Tribit won for its overall consistent sound. At lower volume levels, it was louder and clearer.
