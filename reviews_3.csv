RZSR6HETN19GU,B0CY6TTR3C,5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound in a portable package,James Donlon,5,"Easy setup like other Sonos experience. Very pleased that the sound is so full for a small speaker. Bought two of these so I can integrate with my other Sonos speakers, spreading sound around the house and on occasion outside. This speaker is great for such flexibility! I also put these two Roam 2 speakers in a stereo pair in a single room and am super impressed by the sound. Worth thinking about two of these as an alternative to more pricey Sonos options for your room. You will get pretty good sound plus flexibility/portability (at the expense of volume and depth of bass sound). Battery life is great, and I like the way the speakers sleep or power down when unplugged and idle for awhile, but stay up and awake if plugged in. The updated Sonos app keeps track of these even when powered off and picks them right up when powered on. Sonos is a great system and these Roam 2 speakers are a great addition for a portable option.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEKPQRCBV3DNLRZCMJSGQMSGSLAA,True,1,Color: Black

R1OS5DF32WEJSP,B0CY6TTR3C,"1.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker, Horrible Experience",Matthew Keefe,1,"What can I say. I love Sonos, had the original PlayBar since it was released. Numerous speakers around the house, Sonos Move for outdoors and decided to pick up a Roam for travel. The speaker sounds amazing, especially for its size... however I can't add it to the Sonos ecosystem. Its a lone item, but whats worse is my other speakers are also missing from the mobile app now. I'm not alone in this, but unfortunately Sonos doesn't seem to care about it. Sadly this one will be going back, its too expensive for solely being a Bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AFNZEBTUZMRH3OPVX7NYYD5ZH6SA,True,5,Color: Black
RZ3JZ2VUDV1OA,B0CY6TTR3C,4.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming performance,M. Alvarez,4,"So, the positives right up front. Very small and portable. Simplistic but stylish. Easy to use and setup. Love the dedicated Bluetooth. Comes well packaged from Sonos. Very small and for its size, puts out good volume.Now the potential cons. I have a Sonos Arc and the Sonos Move (1st Gen). Got them both for a great sale price and the sound quality never ceases to impress me. Especially the Move, which even at very high volumes plays great music from rock, country and rap. I bought the roam to be more portable than my Move, which I use on the deck, poolside or at small gatherings. The Roam was more for hiking, beach trips and casual listening washing the car, etc. I have to say I am not impressed. It sounds decent at its highest volume although you can tell you’ve reached its limit. I never feel like any of my other Sonos products have hit a limit even at 100% volume. It also sounds almost flat and very mono sounding vs steep or simulated stereo. Worse, it’s okay with rock or country or anything that has very little bass, but don’t try and play any kind of rap or hip hip. The bass is almost non-existent and really makes it feel like you’re pushing the speakers beyond their capabilities.Granted, most small portable like this would have similar issues, but when I listen to my sons JBL Flip 5, which costs less than half the price, I feel like the bass is much richer and the sound is louder, but of relatively similar quality as the Sonos, which is very disappointing. Maybe I’m missing the mark on its intended use, but I don’t think so. For small sound and high portability, it’s okay, but feels overpriced when compared to a couple others for what it offers.Would have considered a slightly larger roam in its 2nd generation for larger speakers or drivers or a dedicated bass port. I’ll have to sample it for a while and along others. I’m on the fence keeping it vs returning it. I’ll update my decision later.UPDATE: okay, after using it down at the beach, I would have to say my opinion has changed some. While I still would like a bit more volume, it’s pretty good for small spaces and close to me or around the pool or campfire. Sound has grown on me for most music and I recognize what it is for its ultra portability. Battery life is good and it’s been easy to pair. Loud enough to enjoy, but not so loud as to annoy others around me at the beach. I bought it at full price for $179. If you wait for Prime Day or other major sales days, it drops to $143, which is a much more reasonable price where it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEFLVYVERRDW3B3YBXQF7SKRBXHA,True,7,Color: White

Sounds great and nothing it's size I have heard is this crisp. Size is the key feature here so if you have more room for a larger portable speaker, then there are other options. Using it as a laptop speaker... well bluetooth takes at least 2 full minutes to click on each morning I start my day, so when I join my first meeting, people are talking and I can't hear anything. Biggest flaw, no matter what I do, Amazon Alexa will not connect to this speaker. I have sonos arc, sub, 300s, and a move 2 that are excellent and connected, but this little guy just hangs in the app with Connecting to Amazon.

It has great tonality and an expansive sound stage, one which is tailored to your listening area. I have tried a lot of mobile blue tooth speakers, and this is one of the best in terms of audio quality, which is, absolutely, one of the most impot5rant factors, really the most important. I would compare it only to the Klipsch, B & O, Devialet.So why did I rate it 4 stars?1. I find it insulting or worse when a piece of equipment in this price range is so intrusive, puts so much effort into violating your privacy. Install the app and you will have none. I fully intend to uninstall rhe app. I may even do a full reset on my phone, but having installed it and created an accoujnt I asm already on a list they wil undoubtedly be selling.You can set up blue tooth without the app, but not wifi. Having connected to blue tooth I had to reset the speaker to install the app. It took me hou4rs, much like the B & O, which I was unhappy with for exactly the same reasons.*IF* you use th3 app you can not use a music player. I personally hate listening to music on my phone. In fact, I needed to make a call but couldn't because I was using the speaker, and it completely drained the battery on my phone. (Wifi and blue tooth will do that) make a call and could not because I was using the speaker. It also completely drained my phone's battery.2. Using a player would not have given me the benefits I get on many other blue tooth speakers because the Roam does not process lossless blue tooth codecs. You lose detail in transmission. Not everyone cares about this but most audiophile listeners do, so for a company of this quality, producing equipment in this price range, it is surprising and disappointing.No aptx, aptx hd or ldac.It does do some tricks if you have other Sonos speakers, like casting to the speaker in the next room.3. IPX rating questionable. The port is open, uncovered. I would not take this speaker to the beach, or even out ion the rain.With or without the app? The app does get you spatial tuning, BUT, besides issues already mentioned I lost the DAC on my FIIO, in addition to lossless blue tooth.In sum, the sound is very good but I feel that you pay a high price for it in terms of intrusiveness.I do not feel as though I would be sacrificing a great deal if I listened to my Klipsch instead, on my FIIO, weith location... turned off on my phone. We all have our priorities.

The size is easy to carry around, and it has really good sound for such a small form factor. The Alexa integration is also very good - you can power up the speaker and ask Alexa to play anything through connected services like Spotify or other music libraries and it does what you expect it to do - play music! The real let down is in in the recent overhaul of the Sonos app. Unfortunately, Sonos took a very good functioning S2 app and ruined it when they relaunched the app to handle the new Sonos Ace headphones. They've been working on re-adding features for the last two months and it's starting to improve, but very slowly. So buyer beware - you may want to wait until they get the app back to a more solid state before you jump into a Roam. However, the Roam does work well with Bluetooth and Airplay, so for now that's a great way to still play music.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AH2NLQV3HKYPSPZJAU2FGCUV37GA,False,0,Color: Black

This is easy competition for Beats pill or the Bose versions in this size group and better in many ways. One of the ways is the tech. Also known as the bad reviews, at least for now. They need to update some areas with the software and the app. This needs to work perfect for what it cost (I hope you hear me Sonos!). If they fix the connectivity and wifi issues this is a winner.

I was impressed with the low end of this speaker for its compact small size, but other than that, I can’t say that I would recommend on sound quality. The high end is completely missing and adjusting via the setting does virtually nothing. I want to qualify that with the fact I understand I’m not getting a live performance out of this thing but there really is no high end. I did t have any issues connecting to the product via Bluetooth as other have stated but if that is the case a software update should fix those. I had and issue at first hooking Apple Music into it but a reboot of my phone and the speaker fixed that. Its small size makes it versatile and it surely feels like a quality product. Battery life is good while overall performance is meh middle of the road. I have heard great things about Sonos products but I’m not sold yet.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AFA34467RZQ7UBJVQG2TQ3JJDYFQ,False,0,Color: Black

RREJBMWBR7Y7K,B0CY6TTR3C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good product. Very loud.,Just Some Guy,4,"The media could not be loaded. This is a pretty nice portable speaker. I've used Sonos speakers in the past and was pretty impressed with those. This speaker in particular though, I have to honestly say is not quite as good as some other Sonos I have used in the past. Pairing over Bluetooth is simple, as with like any other Bluetooth speaker or other device. Pairing is the same. But like the other Sonos speakers this is also made specifically to work with the Sonos App in which you can connect multiple speakers throughout a home. That works well but I struggle to see why that'd be important on a portable speaker. I suppose it is nice to have the option. The sound is very good. It can get loud enough for a whole room. The trembles and mids are nice and clear. The bass is loud too (but I did notice some mudding at higher volume which is honestly to be expected with a portable speaker like this.) I took off the one star for this.Overall I think this is a very good speaker and people who want the Sonos app connectivity will love this. But I took off the one star because the sound is about the same as some other premium Bluetooth speakers that cost significantly less. That being said, this is still a good pick for people who want that app connectivity or just like the Sonos brand. I am satisfied with it.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AFS2T4U7QKGVSZ6AFT3ZNA7DY2IA,False,0,Color: Black

Setup was pretty straightforward, but I did need to reboot it a couple times to get it to properly play in sync with the other speakers. I think that may have just been a one-time thing, since it's worked perfectly every other time I've sent music to it.In terms of sound, it's pretty good. It doesn't have a super rich bass, compared to my other Sonos speakers, but it's still decent. I use the overture from Tron: Legacy as a test track, so I have a reference I can compare on each speaker I listen on, and it does miss some of the really rich deep notes when the music swells at around 1:35.All that said, this isn't a one-speaker-replacement for an amazing sound system. It's a portable speaker that sounds pretty great, which is suitable for taking outdoors and can sync with your existing Sonos system, and it excels at that. I mostly use it as a small portable speaker playing jazz on my back patio during family get-togethers or dinner, and to supplement my existing Sonos system, and it is perfect for that.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AH2DY3SGYMCGUSFYXZLQO2S7XLBQ,False,2,Color: Black

R19FQOL0LFI9SO,B0CY6TTR3C,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little bar",Staple,5,"Ordered this to use for a satellite speaker for some home automation. In this case, I used Home Assistant to connect to the Sonos Roam 2 and send audio. In my case, I have the speaker plugged into trickle charge as I mostly have power where it’s at, but the battery as a little battery back up so I can continue to control it even when there is no power at that location. Battery life is about as you would expect for something of that size. Nothing too stellar but nothing that’s gonna drop off ridiculously quick either.Sound quality wise, this lives up to the Sonos name. Sound was rich and full with no issues at any of the extremes. Adjustability and control are exactly as Sonos advertises and they work great. While there is a microphone included, I did not test that feature, though I would imagine, it should work.It also has Bluetooth and that seems to work well. It pairs nicely and you can send audio to it just fine. Range is about as expected with no problems that I experienced.About the only thing that should be noted is it really wants a high-speed USB-C charger. And my case I trickle charge it over an old-school USB charger and it warns me, but it sits plugged in most of the time so it’s OK. If you want to charge it faster though you’re going to need to use a proper USB-C charger.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHNR76YHIEJ2R73EOK6VHX22YYVA,False,0,Color: Black

Sonos knows they did some things on SONOS Roam 1 that made people unhappy. The SONOS ROAM 2 fixes all of that.Bluetooth out the box: The 2 has a dedicated On Button and Bluetooth Button. You can Bluetooth straight out the box. The first one required you to do Wi-fi setup.Perfect Shower Speaker: It is IPX67 which allows it to be submerged in 3 ft of water for 30 minutes. And the trueplay makes it the best shower speaker. It’ll adjust the acoustic and the bass to sound amazing in the shower where usually there’s echoy walls. True play takes care of that. If you take it to the beach, it’ll put all the drivers on blast and make sure you can hear it in an open environment. Wifi and smart features allows it to be used in the shower without your iphone too!SONOS Integration: The integration is the best thing ever. I can listen to music anywhere around the house through wifi. And when I get back into the house I can go and hold the play button and it’ll transfer what I’m listening to on the bigger sound system (i.e. SONOS arc, more to be added soon.)SOUND QUALITY: It’s the best speaker at this size. I’ve had comparable speakers and I’ve only been impressed with Bose. This gives bose a run for it’s money, integration, and pure beauty. It’s bass is full and the high mids and lows are all there.

This speaker sounds good, not quite as nice as the Sonos 1 but when they are paired together I can't really tell the difference. I'm not an aficionado by any means but when I had these two playing together, it made me go ""Oh, I should get another Sonos 1, that'd sound real nice"". Initial set up with Bluetooth was simple, but getting it to pair with my Sonos 1 took a couple minutes, a WTF, and a phone restart to get everything synced up. I wish charging status light would stay on while charging, mine doesn't even with the status light enabled in app. Also wish battery % wasn't buried so far down the app, it should be right there on the main screen in the app. Is this the best speaker at this size and price, I don't know but probably not.. I know you can get a good bluetooth speaker for less than this. Does that speaker play well with another Sonos speaker? No. If you're invested in the Sono ecosystem, I think you would like this.

Like all the other Sonos devices we have, the sound it top rate. It really performs like a much larger speaker and will easily fill a large room at adequate volume.

The sound is very, very good. For jazz, it is refined, revealing the highs of a tinkling cymbal to steady bass lines; the sound is well-articulated. For something like Beyonce's Cowboy Carter, it revealed the lower nuances in her voice and a pleasantly booming bass. Overall, I found that the sound was fuller and richer at higher volumes, something I did not expect. It is absolutely stunning in a large room out by the pool. At lower volumes in my office, it feels slightly underpowered. At high volumes in my office...well, I don't get much done. I love this little thing!

There isn’t an employee at Sonos who isn’t pained by having let you down, and I assure you that fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be our number one priority.We developed the new app to create a better experience, with the ability to drive more innovation in the future, and with the knowledge that it would get better over time. However, since launch we have found a number of issues. Fixing these issues has delayed our prior plan to quickly incorporate missing features and functionality.Since May 7, we have released new software updates approximately every two weeks, each making significant and meaningful improvements, adding features and fixing bugs. Please see the release notes for Sonos software updates for detailed information on what has been released to date.While these software updates have enabled the majority of our customers to have a robust experience using the Sonos app, there is more work to be done. We have prioritized the following improvements in our next phase of software updates:July and August:- Improving the stability when adding new products- Implementing Music Library configuration, browse, search, and playAugust and September:- Improving Volume responsiveness- User interface improvements based on customer feedback- Improving overall system stability and error handlingSeptember:- Improving Alarm consistency and reliabilitySeptember and October:- Restoring edit mode for Playlists and the Queue- Improving functionality in settings- We plan to continue releasing new software updates on a bi-weekly cadence. With each release, we will share detailed notes on what we’ve addressed and what we’re working on next in our Community.We deeply appreciate your patience as we address these issues.
